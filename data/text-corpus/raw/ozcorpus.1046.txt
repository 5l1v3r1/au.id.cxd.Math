MONDAY 1 SEPTEMBER 1980
EDITORIAL OPINION
"A BLAND BUT USEFUL START"
THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO THE AUSTRALIAN
FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAS RELEASED ITS INTERIM
REPORT AND ON FIRST READING IT IS A DISAPPOINTING
DOCUMENT. THE 572-PAGE REPORT CONTAINS NO
RECOMMENDATIONS, NO COMMENT ON THE MAJOR
ISSUES RAISED AND LITTLE ANALYSIS OF THOSE ISSUES
OR THE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED BY GROUPS WHICH
MADE SUBMISSIONS OR APPEARED AT THE
COMMITTEE'S PUBLIC HEARINGS.
HOWEVER, THE COMMITTEE, WHICH IS CHAIRED
BY SYDNEY BUSINESSMAN MR KEITH CAMPBELL,
REPRESENTS THE FIRST ATTEMPT IN MORE THAN 40
YEARS TO EXAMINE THE COUNTRY'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THEN THAT IT SAW ITS FIRST
TASK AS DOCUMENTING THE SYSTEM AND THUS DEFINING
THE MAIN AREAS OF CONCERN OR AGREEMENT. THESE
COULD THEN FORM THE BASIS FOR RECOMMENDATIONS
- EITHER FOR CHANGE OR MAINTENANCE OF THE STATUS
QUO. THE LAST LOOK AT THE SYSTEM WAS IN THE
1930S, A ROYAL COMMISSION ON WHAT WAS THEN
THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL STRUCTURE: BANKING. BUT SINCE
WORLD WAR II THERE HAVE BEEN DRAMATIC CHANGES
THE RANGE AND NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
HAVE GROWN ENORMOUSLY AS HAVE THE VARIETY AND
SOPHISTICATION OF SERVICES AVAILABLE. AND
PERHAPS OF GREATEST IMPORTANCE HAS BEEN THE
GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT BOTH IN
REGULATION OF THE SYSTEM AND THE ACHIEVEMENT
OF SPECIFIC POLITICAL AIMS LIKE CHEAP HOUSING
LOANS OR RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT. ALL THIS IS WELL
DOCUMENTED IN THE REPORT.
ONCE THIS APPROACH IS UNDERSTOOD, THE
COMMITTEE'S INTERIM REPORT TAKES ON NEW
MEANING. IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE AND INVALUABLE
TEXTBOOK OF THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM,
ALBEIT A LITTLE TOO BLAND BECAUSE OF THE
COMMITTEE'S CONCERN FOR STRICT NEUTRALITY. THIS
IS NO DOUBT TO AVOID GIVING EVEN THE SLIGHTEST
HINT OF THE DIRECTION ITS FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
WILL TAKE. IT IS UNFORTUNATE, HOWEVER, THAT THE
COMMITTEE DID NOT MAKE THIS APPROACH CLEARER.
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED BY CALLING THE
DOCUMENT A WORKING PAPER OR THE FIRST PART OF
THE INTERIM REPORT. SUCH AN APPROACH WOULD
HAVE LEFT OPEN THE WAY FOR A MORE CONVENTIONAL
INTERIM REPORT EARLY NEXT YEAR IN WHICH THE MAJOR
ISSUES COULD HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AHEAD OF THE
FINAL REPORT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS LATER IN 1981.
INDEED, THE VERY BLANDNESS OF THE INTERIM
REPORT MAKES A SECOND INTERIM REPORT
ESSENTIAL ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEE INTENDS TO
MOVE STRAIGHT TO A FINAL REPORT.
ONE CAN ALSO UNDERSTAND SOME POLITICAL
MOTIVATIONS IN THE REPORT'S STYLE. GIVEN THE
SUCCESS OF A NUMBER OF PRESSURE GROUPS (SUCH
AS THE STOCKBROKERS ESCAPING THE SCRUTINY OF THE
TRADE PRACTICES COMMISSION) IN WINNING POINTS
IN CANBERRA, MR CAMPBELL WAS PROBABLY
CONCERNED NOT TO TELEGRAPH HIS PUNCHES,
PARTICULARLY IN A PRE-ELECTION ENVIRONMENT. THE
COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED WITH A CLEAR FREER
ENTERPRISE CHARTER AND THERE IS CONSIDERABLE
DOUBT THAT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD APPEAL
TO AN INTERVENTIONIST LABOR GOVERNMENT. IF LABOR
DID WIN THE COMING ELECTION, THE CAMPBELL
REPORT'S CHANCES OF BEING PIGEON-HOLED - ALWAYS
HIGH FOR REPORTS OF THIS KIND - WOULD RISE
CONSIDERABLY. NEITHER THE ACTU NOR THE FEDERAL
OPPOSITION HAVE YET MADE ANY SUBMISSIONS TO
OR APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMITTEE.
THUS THE REPORT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS AN
INDICATION OF SLOW PROGRESS BY THE COMMITTEE.
INDEED, IT HAS FOCUSED THE MAJOR ISSUES:
GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, THE ROLE OF BANKS AND
THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RESERVE BANK, THE
ENTRY OF FOREIGN BANKS, FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS OF
OUR EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM, THE PROTECTION OF
DEPOSITORS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, THE
APPROPRIATE METHOD OF ASSISTING SPECIAL GROUPS
AND THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM OVERALL. IT HAS
ALSO RAISED AREAS OF CONSENSUS, BOTH WHERE THE
SYSTEM IS WORKING WELL AND WHERE IT IS NOT.
HOWEVER, THE COMMITTEE WILL HAVE TO SHOW IT
CAN COME TO TERMS WITH THESE AND OTHER ISSUES
AND CONSTRUCT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT KNIT THE
COMPLEX OF VARIOUS OBJECTIVES TOGETHER WITHOUT
UNDERMINING THOSE AREAS WHERE IT RECOMMENDS
NO CHANGE. IT ALSO MUST AVOID ADDING ANOTHER
LAYER OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION.
ONE OF THE CLEAR MESSAGES THAT HAS EMERGED
FROM THE COURSE OF THE INQUIRY IS THE STRENGTH
AND ADAPTABILITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL
SYSTEM. AND, IN THE MAIN, THE VARIOUS
INSTITUTIONS THAT COMPRISE THE SYSTEM RETAIN THE
CONFIDENCE OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IT WILL BE
IMPORTANT TO BUILD ON THIS SOUND BASE.
"ABORIGINAL HEALTH SERVICE FAILURE"
THE PROVISION OF ADEQUATE MEDICAL SERVICES
FOR ABORIGINES IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS VEXED
ALL AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS. NO MATTER HOW
MUCH MONEY AND GOOD WILL IS INVESTED, THE
RETURNS USUALLY ARE DISAPPOINTING. SCORES OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT OVER THE
YEARS IN AN EFFORT TO GIVE MOST ABORIGINES ACCESS
TO THE SAME STANDARD OF HEALTH CARE EXPECTED BY
OTHER AUSTRALIANS. BUT MANY PROGRAMMES HAVE
FAILED. THE LATEST HAS BEEN THE VICTORIAN HEALTH
COMMISSION'S SCHEME TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF
ABORIGINAL CHILDREN IN THE SHEPPARTON-MOOROOPNA
AREA. A REPORT TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT,
RELEASED ON FRIDAY, PAINTED A DISMAL PICTURE OF
WIDESPREAD MALNUTRITION AMONG THE CHILDREN,
INFECTIOUS DISEASE REMAINING RAMPANT AND THE
NUMBER OF STILLBIRTHS RUNNING AT FOUR TIMES THE
STATE AVERAGE.
THE AUTHOR OF THE REPORT WAS DR IAN
WRONSKI, OF THE COMMISSION'S ABORIGINAL HEALTH
SECTION. HE SAID THE SECTION HAD TRIED, BUT FAILED,
TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE HEALTH SERVICES
AVAILABLE TO WHITES AND TO THE ABORIGINAL
COMMUNITY BY PROVIDING TRANSPORT AND EDUCATION
TO ABORIGINES INSTEAD OF ENCOURAGING THE
DEVELOPMENT OF SEPARATE FACILITIES. DR WRONSKI
SAID THIS FAILURE MEANT THAT THE SECTION'S ROLE
SHOULD BE COMPLETELY REASSESSED. IT IS
ENCOURAGING TO NOTE THAT THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH,
MR BORTHWICK, APPEARS TO HAVE MOVED QUICKLY
TO CORRECT THE PROGRAMME'S SHORTCOMINGS. HE
ADMITTED ON FRIDAY THAT THE SCHEME HAD
FAILED AND ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD MEET
REPRESENTATIVES OF ABORIGINAL HEALTH AND WELFARE
SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ABORIGINAL
AFFAIRS THIS WEEK TO DISCUSS DR WRONSKI'S
RECOMMENDATIONS.
THERE APPEAR TO BE TWO PROBLEMS FACING
THE HEALTH COMMISSION AND THE GOVERNMENT.
CLEARLY, THERE IS A NEED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION TO
OVERCOME THE POOR HEALTH OF ABORIGINAL CHILDREN
IN THE SHEPPARTON AREA. THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT
ALLOW A SITUATION TO CONTINUE IN WHICH FREQUENT
ILLNESS, POOR ANTE-NATAL CARE, MALNUTRITION,
STUNTED GROWTH AND SLOW INTELLECTUAL
DEVELOPMENT CAUSED BY FREQUENT ABSENCE FROM
SCHOOL ARE AS COMMON AS DR WRONSKI CLAIMS.
BUT FOR THE LONGER TERM, THERE NEEDS TO BE
A COMPREHENSIVE REVISION OF THE HEALTH
COMMISSION'S AIMS AND PROCEDURES. AS MR
BORTHWICK SAID ON FRIDAY, DR WRONSKI'S FINDINGS
CAN REASONABLY BE TAKEN AS A REFLECTION OF THE
HEALTH OF ABORIGINAL CHILDREN ACROSS THE STATE.
THE FIRST STEP SHOULD BE TO INVOLVE
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES
MORE CLOSELY IN THE PLANNING OF HEALTH SERVICES.
WITHOUT SUCH AN INPUT THE SERVICE WILL CONTINUE
TO APPEAR ALIEN TO ABORIGINES' NEEDS AND THEIR
OWN PARTICULAR SENSITIVITIES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY
TRUE IF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, INCLUDING SOME
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN TRADITIONAL LIFE-STYLE AND
DIET, IS GIVEN THE EMPHASIS IT APPEARS TO DESERVE.
IT MIGHT EVEN BE WORTH ENCOURAGING ABORIGINAL
COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP, WITH GOVERNMENT
ASSISTANCE, THEIR OWN MEDICAL SERVICES.

THURSDAY 4 SEPTEMBER 1980
"ROUGH JUSTICE FOR SCULPTURE"
JUST FOR ONCE, WHEN A LITTLE CARE AND THOUGHT
WAS NEEDED, MELBOURNE'S CITY COUNCILLORS
HAVE DECIDED TO ACT WITH SPEED AND PROMPTNESS
AND RID THE CITY SQUARE OF ITS CONTROVERSIAL
YELLOW METAL SCULPTURE. NEVER MIND THAT THE
SCULPTOR HIMSELF, MR RON ROBERTSON-SWANN, WAS
NOT CONSULTED ABOUT THE MOVE; NOR THAT IT WILL
COST MELBOURNE'S RATEPAYERS ANOTHER $23,000 IN
ADDITION TO THE $70,000 ALREADY PAID FOR THE
WORK. THE TOWN HALL ART EXPERTS HAVE DECIDED,
WITH THE HELP OF OPINION POLLS, THAT THE "YELLOW
PERIL", AS IT IS NOW KNOWN, IS AN EYESORE AND A
PUBLIC NUISANCE, AND AS SUCH SHOULD GO - WITH
ALL POSSIBLE SPEED.
THEIR DECISION IS AS SHORTSIGHTED AS IT IS
HASTY. BATMAN PARK, THE WORK'S NEW HOME-TO-BE,
IS A PARK IN NAME ONLY. WORK ON IT WON'T BEGIN
FOR ANOTHER MONTH OR TWO, AND THE PARK WON'T
BE READY FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS AFTER THAT. IT
WOULD MAKE FAR MORE SENSE TO LEAVE THE
SCULPTURE WHERE IT IS WHILE THE PARK IS DESIGNED
AND BUILT, RATHER THAN MOVE IT NOW, THEREBY
CONDEMNING IT TO SIT IN A BED OF MUD FOR MONTHS
AMONG THE BULLDOZERS. BESIDES, MR ROBERTSON-
SWANN, WHO MUST BE RECKONED TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIS OWN ARTEFACT THAN
THE CITY COUNCILLORS, SAYS THAT EXTENSIVE
ENGINEERING WORK WILL BE NEEDED TO DETERMINE
THE METHOD OF UNDERPINNING TO BE USED ON ANY
NEW SITE. THE PIECE WEIGHS 30 TONNES. THE LORD
MAYOR HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE SCULPTURE COULD
BE MOVED IN TWO WEEKS. MR ROBERTSON-SWANN
SAYS THAT THIS NOTION IS "TECHNICALLY ABSURD".
A SECOND REASON FOR LEAVING THE SCULPTURE
WHERE IT IS, FOR THE PRESENT ANYWAY, IS SIMPLY
THAT IT WAS COMMISSIONED AND DESIGNED WITH THE
CITY SQUARE IN MIND. PERHAPS MR. ROBERTSON-
SWANN HAS NOT PLEASED EVERYBODY; BUT IS THAT
EVER AN ARTIST'S INTENTION? PERHAPS A STATUE OR A
FOUNTAIN WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE;
BUT THE COUNCIL COMMISSIONED A SCULPTURE. AT
LEAST THE COUNCIL SHOULD GIVE THE PUBLIC TIME TO
ASSIMILATE THE WORK. SIX MONTHS FROM NOW THOSE
WHO PROFESSED TO BE SHOCKED AT FIRST MAY HAVE
GROWN TO LIKE IT. IF NOT, THE IDEA OF MOVING IT
CAN BE RECONSIDERED. BY THEN, WE WILL HAVE A
BETTER IDEA OF HOW IT WOULD LOOK IN BATMAN
PARK. MEANWHILE, BOTH THE SCULPTURE AND THE
SCULPTOR DESERVE A FAIRER AND A LONGER TRIAL.
"BLEAK TIMES FOR SOUTH KOREA"
FOR AN OBSCURE SOUTH KOREAN ARMY OFFICER,
GENERAL CHUN DOO HWAN HAS COME A LONG
WAY SINCE THE "NIGHT OF THE GENERALS" IN
DECEMBER LAST YEAR. TODAY HE IS PRESIDENT OF A
COUNTRY THAT IS, IN HIS OWN WORDS, ABOUT TO
"BREATHE THE REFRESHING AIR OF ANOTHER ERA".
HOWEVER, THE FACT IS THAT THE AIR OF SOUTH KOREA
TODAY SMELLS MUCH THE SAME AS IT DID BEFORE THE
ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT PARK. ALTHOUGH
THOUSANDS OF CORRUPT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN
DISMISSED, GENERAL CHUN'S CRITICS, TOO, ARE BEING
SUPPRESSED. THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN
CLOSED. RELIGIOUS LEADERS OF SUSPECT LOYALTY HAVE
BEEN ARRESTED. UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN SHUT.
THE LEADING DISSIDENT MR KIM DAE JUNG, WHO
BEFORE HIS ARREST IN MAY WAS CONSIDERED SOUTH
KOREA'S MOST POPULAR POLITICIAN, IS ON TRIAL FOR
HIS LIFE. THE PRESS IS UNDER SIEGE. HUNDREDS OF
JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN SACKED OR ARRESTED. SCORES
OF PUBLISHING COMPANIES AND PERIODICALS HAVE
BEEN CLOSED, ALL IN THE NAME OF GENERAL CHUN'S
DRIVE FOR "PURITY" AND THE SEARCH FOR "A FORM
OF DEMOCRACY THAT BEST SUITS OUR HISTORICAL
CIRCUMSTANCES AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND". A NEW
CONSTITUTION IS BEING DRAWN UP BY A GROUP OF
THE FAITHFUL. AND WHILE THERE ARE PROMISES OF A
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE
IT CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE NO ROOM FOR
PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS. SOUTH KOREA, LESS THAN A
YEAR AFTER PRESIDENT PARK'S DEATH, IS GETTING THE
SAME OLD TREATMENT, ONLY MORE SO. THIS TIME THERE
ARE SHADES OF KIM IL SUNG, THE NORTH KOREAN
LEADER, IN THE PERSONALITY CULT BEGINNING TO
SURROUND GENERAL CHUN. SURELY THE SOUTH
KOREANS DESERVE A BETTER FUTURE.

THURSDAY 11 SEPTEMBER 1980
"TELL US WHY, MR KILLEN"
THE TIMING, ALTHOUGH NOT THE SUBDUED TONE, OF
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DEFENCE ANNOUNCE-
MENT ADDS WEIGHT TO THE COMMENT THAT A
"KHAKI ELECTION" IS IMMINENT. AFTER THE END OF
THE VIETNAM WAR, DEFENCE SLIPPED INTO THE
BACKGROUND AS A POLITICAL ISSUE. BUT THE SOVIET
INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN EARLIER THIS YEAR GAVE
THE PRIME MINISTER - A FORMER DEFENCE MINISTER
AND ALWAYS SUSPICIOUS OF SOVIET AMBITIONS - AN
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING DEFENCE BACK INTO PUBLIC
CONSCIOUSNESS: THIS IS FAIR ENOUGH; INTEREST IN
DEFENCE AND SUPPORT FOR INCREASED EXPENDITURE
REQUIRES, IN A DEMOCRACY, AN IMPETUS. AUSTRALIANS
SHOULD NOT BE DECEIVED, HOWEVER, INTO A BELIEF
THAT DECISIONS TO PROCURE EXPENSIVE WEAPONRY
ARE A CREDIBLE RESPONSE TO PRESENT FEARS OF SOVIET
EXPANSION. GIVEN THE LONG LEAD TIMES, PREPARA-
TION FOR MILITARY CONTINGENCIES ARISING NOW
SHOULD HAVE BEEN BEGUN UP TO 10 YEARS AGO.
THERE IS ALSO A RISK IN MAKING DECISIONS IN AN
APPROACH TO AN ELECTION. FOR ONE THING,
GOVERNMENTS MAY BE TEMPTED TO ANNOUNCE
PROJECTS THAT APPEAR IMPRESSIVE BUT ARE LESS
RELEVANT OR URGENT THAN SPENDING ON LESS
SPECTACULAR REQUIREMENTS. FOR ANOTHER, DEFENCE
POLICY AND COMMITMENTS OUGHT TO BE BIPARTISAN
RATHER THAN THE SUBJECT OF POLITICAL CONTROVERSY
IN AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
THE DECISION TO SPEND $1000 MILLION ON
BUYING AND EQUIPPING A LIGHT AIRCRAFT CARRIER TO
REPLACE THE ELDERLY AND INCREASINGLY COSTLY
HMAS MELBOURNE COULD BE IN THE CATEGORY OF
AN ELECTION SHOWPIECE. THE NAVY, OF COURSE, HAS
LOBBIED LONG AND HARD TO KEEP THE FLEET AIR ARM
AND ACQUIRE AN IMPRESSIVE NEW FLAGSHIP. BUT THE
DEFENCE MINISTER, MR KILLEN, HAS NOT BOTHERED
TO EXPLAIN THE REASONING BEHIND THE DECISION, OR
TO CLARIFY THE ROLE THE NEW VESSEL IS TO PLAY. HE
SAID THE CARRIER WOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH
HELICOPTERS: A DECISION ON WHETHER TO BUY SHORT
TAKE-OFF AND VERTICAL LANDING (STOVL) AIRCRAFT
WOULD NOT BE MADE FOR THREE YEARS. THE
HELICOPTERS WOULD PROVIDE AN INCREASED ANTI-
SUBMARINE CAPACITY, WHICH THE NAVY ARGUES IS
NECESSARY TO PROTECT AUSTRALIA'S VITAL SEA LINKS.
SOME DEFENCE CRITICS QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS A
WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT IN PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.
MOST SHIPPING CARRYING AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS AND
IMPORTS IS FOREIGN-OWNED, AND THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR PROTECTING IT AT TIME OF WAR IS NOT PRIMARILY
AUSTRALIA'S. THERE IS DOUBT, TOO, WHETHER IT NOW
IS PRACTICABLE TO PROTECT SUPPLY CONVOYS AGAINST
SUBMARINE ATTACK, AND IT MAY BE ARGUED THAT THE
EMPHASIS SHOULD BE ON A FLEET OF SUBMARINES,
DESTROYERS AND PATROL BOATS.
THE CONCENTRATION ON ANTI-SUBMARINE
CAPACITY STEMS FROM THE STRATEGIC THINKING OF
THE 1950S, WHEN THE ROLE OF THE ROYAL AUSTRALIAN
NAVY WAS SEEN MAINLY AS SUPPORTING THE US
PACIFIC FLEET. SINCE THEN THE UNITED STATES HAS
MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT EXPECTS ITS ALLIES TO ADOPT
A MORE INDEPENDENT AND SELF-RELIANT DEFENCE
POSTURE. THE NAVY AND THE CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE
FORCE STAFF, ADMIRAL SIR ANTHONY SYNOTT, HAVE
PROPOSED ANOTHER POTENTIAL ROLE FOR AN AIRCRAFT
CARRIER. EQUIPPED WITH STOVL AIRCRAFT -
PROVIDED THE RIGHT AIRCRAFT ARE READILY AVAILABLE
- IT WOULD PROVIDE THE CAPACITY TO PROJECT
MILITARY POWER FAR BEYOND AUSTRALIA'S SHORES AS
A FORMIDABLE DETERRENT TO POSSIBLE AGGRESSION.
AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER COULD CERTAINLY BE DEPLOYED
BEYOND THE RANGE OF AUSTRALIA'S LAND-BASED F-111
STRIKE AIRCRAFT, BUT THIS "BLUE-WATER" AMBITION
SEEMS TO BE AT VARIANCE WITH THE 1976 DEFENCE
WHITE PAPER'S PROCLAIMED PRINCIPLES OF CONTI-
NENTAL RATHER THAN FORWARD DEFENCE. THERE IS ALSO
THE VERY PRACTICAL PROBLEM FOR A NATION OF
LIMITED RESOURCES OF CONCENTRATING SO MUCH
OF ITS DEFENSIVE (OR DETERRENT) CAPACITY ON ONE
VULNERABLE HULL. TO REDUCE THAT VULNERABILITY, THE
CARRIER WOULD PRESUMABLY BE ACCOMPANIED ON
DISTANT MISSIONS BY A FLOCK OF ESCORT VESSELS,
WHICH WOULD DIVERT A CONSIDERABLE PROPORTION OF
THE TOTAL FLEET.
THE DECISION TO BUY A NEW AIRCRAFT CARRIER
SEEMS SYMPTOMATIC OF WHAT CRITICS HAVE CALLED
THE "REPLACEMENT SYNDROME", WHICH IS ALSO
APPARENT IN THE FORTHCOMING CHOICE OF A NEW
TACTICAL FIGHTER TO REPLACE THE AGEING MIRAGE IIIS.
THE ARMED SERVICES FIND IT EASIER TO SEEK, AND
GOVERNMENTS FIND IT EASIER TO FUND, REPLACEMENTS
FOR EXISTING WEAPONRY RATHER THAN TO RETHINK
THE UNDERLYING STRATEGIC RATIONALE OR TO CONSIDER
ALTERNATIVES. INDEED, THEY SOMETIMES GIVE THE
IMPRESSION OF DECIDING ON WHAT TO BUY AND THEN
FINDING JUSTIFICATIONS FOR IT, INSTEAD OF FIRST
DETERMINING AUSTRALIA'S STRATEGIC NEEDS AND THEN
FINDING THE MOST ECONOMICAL AND EFFECTIVE MEANS
OF MEETING THEM. THE DECISION TO BASE THE 75
NEW TACTICAL FIGHTERS AT DARWIN MAKES SENSE, IF
NEW TACTICAL FIGHTERS ARE WHAT AUSTRALIA REALLY
NEEDS. SOME DEFENCE STRATEGISTS BELIEVE THE
$2000 MILLION COULD BE SPENT MORE EFFECTIVELY.
SIMILARLY, THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT TWO GUIDED
MISSILE FRIGATES WILL BE BUILT AT WILLIAMSTOWN
DOCKYARD (INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS PERMITTING) IS
GOOD NEWS, BUT IT MAY BE ASKED WHETHER THE
MONEY ALLOCATED FOR A NEW CARRIER MIGHT NOT
BE BETTER SPENT ON EXTRA FRIGATES AND PATROL
BOATS, OR ON ADVANCED MISSILE LAUNCHERS.
MR KILLEN'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE UNITED
STATES HAD FORMALLY ASKED FOR PERMISSION TO USE
AUSTRALIAN AIRFIELDS AS STAGING BASES FOR B-52
STRATEGIC BOMBERS WILL AROUSE MIXED FEELINGS IN
THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER
WASHINGTON PRESSED FOR THIS FACILITY OR WHETHER
THE FRASER GOVERNMENT LOBBIED FOR THE REQUEST.
DESPITE SOME FEARS THAT THE PRESENCE OF
NUCLEAR-ARMED BOMBERS COULD EXPOSE AUSTRALIA
TO A GREATER RISK OF NUCLEAR RETALIATION IN THE
EVENT OF GREAT POWER HOSTILITIES, IT WOULD BE
SHORT-SIGHTED AND CHURLISH OF AUSTRALIA NOT TO
CO-OPERATE WITH ITS PRINCIPAL ALLY IN THE DEFENCE
OF SHARED INTERESTS. BUT, AS IN THE 1950S AND 60S,
THE PRESENT COALITION GOVERNMENT SEEMS
OVER-EAGER TO LOCK THIS COUNTRY INTO THE ROLE OF A
LOYAL AND SUBSERVIENT ALLY TO A GREAT POWER
WHOSE INTERESTS MAY NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE WITH
OURS. THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING AN UNQUESTIONING
ALLY COULD WELL BE OFFSET BY NERVOUSNESS AMONG
OUR ASIAN NEIGHBORS AND THEIR VIEW OF AUSTRALIA
AS AN AMERICAN SATELLITE. CERTAINLY THE NOTION
THAT SUCH A ROLE WOULD MORE READILY BRING THE
UNITED STATES TO AUSTRALIA'S AID IN REGIONAL
CONFLICTS IN WHICH THE SOVIET UNION IS NOT
DIRECTLY INVOLVED IS LARGELY FANCIFUL. IN SUCH
SITUATIONS AMERICA, AS IT HAS IN THE PAST, WILL
ASSESS ITS OBLIGATIONS AND PRIORITIES ACCORDING TO
ITS OWN PERCEIVED INTERESTS. AUSTRALIA MUST SEEK
GREATER INDEPENDENCE AND SELF-RELIANCE IN ITS
DEFENCE PREPARATIONS, AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD
EXPLAIN HOW ITS LATEST DECISIONS FIT IN WITH THIS
GOAL, IF INDEED THEY DO.
<F4>
FRIDAY 12 SEPTEMBER 1980
"AN INTOLERABLE ANACHRONISM"
THE SAME ACT OF SETTLEMENT OF 1770 WHICH
INHIBITS PRINCE CHARLES FROM MARRYING A
ROMAN CATHOLIC APPEARS TO DISQUALIFY ANY
FOREIGN-BORN CITIZEN FROM HOLDING "ANY OFFICE
OF PLACE OF TRUST EITHER CIVIL OR MILITARY" IN
VICTORIA TODAY. THE STATE GOVERNMENT FEARS IT
DOES. IF SO, AS THE PREMIER, MR HAMER, HAS
SAID, THE APPLICATION OF THIS OLD BRITISH STATUTE
TO A SELF-GOVERNING STATE OF AN INDEPENDENT
NATION IN 1980 IS "ANTIQUATED AND RIDICULOUS".
THE COMMONWEALTH SOLICITOR-GENERAL, MR BYERS,
QC, IS OF THE CONTRARY OPINION, BASED ON A
JUDGMENT BY LORD CHIEF JUSTICE GODDARD IN
ENGLAND MORE THAN 30 YEARS AGO, THAT THE
RELEVANT SECTION OF THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT DOES
NOT APPLY IN VICTORIA OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN
AUSTRALIA.
THESE LEGAL DOUBTS MUST BE CLEARED UP AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ARCHAIC
PROHIBITION, IF IT STILL BINDS THE STATE, ARE QUITE
INTOLERABLE. THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS HAD ITS
SUSPICIONS FOR SOME TIME, AND LAST YEAR ASKED
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO LEGISLATE TO ALLOW
THE STATES TO REPEAL OBSOLETE IMPERIAL LAWS
THAT STILL APPEARED TO BIND THEM. THE PROBLEM
IS THAT THE STATUTE OF WESTMINSTER OF 1931,
WHICH ENABLES THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT
TO REPEAL REPUGNANT BRITISH LEGISLATION, DOES NOT
EXTEND TO THE AUSTRALIAN STATES (ALTHOUGH IT
APPLIES TO THE CANADIAN PROVINCES). QUEENSLAND
AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA, WITH THEIR DISTRUST OF
CANBERRA, SEEM CONTENT WITH THIS STATE OF
AFFAIRS. DESPITE ITS APPREHENSION, THE VICTORIAN
GOVERNMENT HAS ONLY RECENTLY DECIDED IT SHOULD
ACT OVER THE ACT OF SETTLEMENT. THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AUTHORITY, MR
JACK FRASER, AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, WAS STOOD
DOWN LAST WEEK. MRS MARGOT NICHOLLS, AN
AMERICAN WHO HAS JUST BECOME AN AUSTRALIAN
CITIZEN, RESIGNED FROM THE TOWN AND COUNTRY
APPEALS TRIBUNAL. ANOTHER WOMAN, ALSO A
NATURALISED AUSTRALIAN, HAS BEEN ASKED TO TAKE
LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE TRIBUNAL. THE STATE
ATTORNEY-GENERAL, MR STOREY, QC, NOW BELIEVES
STATE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT ARE NOT AFFECTED,
AS THE COLONIAL LAWS VALIDITY ACT GAVE COLONIAL
LEGISLATURES FULL POWERS OVER THEIR CONSTITUTIONS,
AND AS QUALIFICATIONS OF MPS ARE LAID DOWN IN
THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT) ACT. BUT THE
STATUS OF MANY FOREIGN-BORN OFFICIALS IS IN DOUBT.
THE MOST REPUGNANT ASPECT OF THE
TROUBLESOME SECTION IS THAT IT APPEARS TO CREATE
TWO CLASSES OF CITIZEN IN AUSTRALIA. IT DOES NOT
SIMPLY EXCLUDE ALIENS FROM PUBLIC OFFICE. THIS
WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE, ALTHOUGH THERE OUGHT
TO BE PROVISION FOR THE ENGAGEMENT OF NON-
AUSTRALIAN NATIONALS, SUCH AS MR JACK FRASER,
ON CONTRACTS WHERE THEIR EXPERTISE IS OF VALUE
TO THE STATE. THE SECTION - IF IT APPLIES -
ALSO DISCRIMINATES AGAINST AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS
WHO HAVE BEEN NATURALISED. THIS PROVISION IS
DOUBLY INCONGRUOUS BECAUSE BRITISH-BORN
RESIDENTS WHO ARE NOT AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS ARE
ELIGIBLE FOR PUBLIC OFFICE WHILE FOREIGN-BORN
IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE ACQUIRED AUSTRALIAN
CITIZENSHIP ARE NOT. THIS IS UTTERLY CONTRARY TO
THE CONCEPT OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AND TO
THE PRESENT REALITY THAT OFFICIALS UNDER THE
CROWN OWE THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO THE MONARCH AS
QUEEN OF AUSTRALIA, NOT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
OR HER OTHER REALMS.
THE STATE GOVERNMENT MUST URGENTLY
ANSWER THE QUESTION WHETHER THE ACT OF
SETTLEMENT BINDS VICTORIA OR NOT, AND, IF SO,
TO WHAT EXTENT. IF THE ACT DOES, THEN
THE MEANS MUST BE FOUND TO OVERCOME ITS
REPUGNANT PROVISIONS, WHETHER THROUGH ENABLING
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATION OR BY AN APPROACH
TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. INDEED, IT IS TIME
THAT THE WHOLE ARCHAIC RELATIONSHIP OF THE
AUSTRALIAN STATES TO BRITAIN WAS REVISED IN
KEEPING WITH THE INDEPENDENT STATUS OF THE
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH. VICTORIA IS NO LONGER
A COLONY.
"CONFIDENCE AND DISCLOSURE"
THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN TO ESTABLISH A
REGISTER OF THE PECUNIARY AND COMMUNITY
INTERESTS OF SENIOR PUBLIC SERVANTS IS A MOVE IN
THE RIGHT DIRECTION, BUT IT DOES NOT GO FAR
ENOUGH. WHILE IT ENCOURAGES INTEGRITY, IT DOES
NOT GUARANTEE IT. ONLY MINISTERS WILL HAVE
IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THE REGISTER. OTHERS,
INCLUDING GOVERNMENT BACKBENCHERS AND
OPPOSITION MPS, WILL HAVE TO OBTAIN MINISTERIAL
APPROVAL TO EXAMINE IT. HEADS OF STATUTORY
AUTHORITIES, MANY OF WHOM HAVE AS MUCH
TAXPAYERS' MONEY TO PLAY WITH AS HEADS OF
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, WILL NOT BE REQUIRED
TO COMPLETE THE REGISTER. SIMILARLY, PURCHASING
OFFICERS, OVERSEERS OF TENDERS AND CONTRACTS, AND
OTHER DECISION MAKERS, ARE EXCLUDED. AND, LIKE
THE REGISTER OF MPS' INTERESTS, THE NEW REGISTER
WILL NOT INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL INTERESTS OF PUBLIC
SERVANTS' FAMILIES.
IF THE REGISTER IS TO ENGENDER THE
COMMUNITY'S CONFIDENCE IN THE STATE'S
ADMINISTRATION, PRESUMABLY ONE OF ITS CHIEF AIMS,
THESE SHORTCOMINGS NEED TO BE OVERCOME. THE
PUBLIC CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO ASSUME THAT ALL IS
ALWAYS RIGHT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE IF IT IS ONLY
MINISTERS WHO HAVE READY ACCESS TO THE
REGISTER. WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT CORRUPTION
IS COMMON IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE OR THAT
MINISTERS ARE IN LEAGUE WITH THEIR DEPARTMENT
HEADS TO MISUSE THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY. BUT,
UNDER THE PROPOSED SYSTEM, THERE WOULD BE
NOTHING TO STOP A MINISTER, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM
OVERLOOKING OR SUPPRESSING INFORMATION IF HE
FELT IT WAS IN HIS OR HIS GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL
INTERESTS TO DO SO.
THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE REGISTER SHOULD
BE MADE PUBLIC, AS THE OPPOSITION HAS REQUESTED.
PUBLIC SERVANTS HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY. UNLIKE
PARLIAMENTARIANS, WHO ARE ANSWERABLE DIRECTLY
TO THE ELECTORATE AND THEREFORE SHOULD MAKE
THEIR PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL INTERESTS KNOWN TO
THE PUBLIC, THEY ARE EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE.
THEY ARE ANSWERABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT OR, IN
SOME CASES, THE PARLIAMENT. AS LONG AS A
REGISTER OF THEIR INTERESTS IS AVAILABLE TO THE
COMMUNITY'S ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, THE
PUBLIC'S INTERESTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE PROTECTED.
BUT UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN, LABOR AND
NATIONAL PARTY MPS ARE TO BE DENIED ACCESS TO
THE REGISTER, EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE A MINISTER
GIVES APPROVAL. THAT IS NOT SATISFACTORY.
PERHAPS THE LEADERS OF THE LABOR AND NATIONAL
PARTIES COULD BE GIVEN ACCESS TO IT ON A
CONFIDENTIAL BASIS, JUST AS THE FEDERAL
OPPOSITION LEADER IS GIVEN CONFIDENTIAL
BRIEFINGS ON MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY.
THE DECISION TO REQUIRE ONLY ABOUT 20
SENIOR PUBLIC SERVANTS TO COMPLETE THE REGISTER
SHOULD ALSO BE RECONSIDERED. PUBLIC SERVANTS
OTHER THAN HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS ARE IN
POSITIONS WHERE PERSONAL INTERESTS COULD AFFECT
MAJOR DECISIONS. EXECUTIVES OF STATUTORY
AUTHORITIES AND STATE INSTRUMENTALITIES, AS WELL
AS DIVISIONAL AND REGIONAL MANAGERS OF
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, SHOULD BE INCLUDED.
IN FACT, ANY PUBLIC SERVANT WHO HAS DISCRETIONARY
POWERS OVER THE USE OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF
TAXPAYERS' MONEY SHOULD BE INCLUDED. ANOTHER
PROBLEM WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN IS THE
SAME AS ONE OF THE SHORTCOMINGS IN THE REGISTER
OF MPS' PECUNIARY INTERESTS. WHILE ONLY THE
PUBLIC SERVANT'S INTERESTS, AND NOT THOSE OF HIS
FAMILY, ARE LISTED, THE SYSTEM IS OPEN TO ABUSE.
SURELY, FOR A REGISTER TO WORK, THE INTERESTS OF
AN MP'S OR A PUBLIC SERVANT'S FAMILY SHOULD BE
LISTED. UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT MAKES SUCH
CHANGES TO ITS PROPOSAL, THE REGISTER WILL BE AN
INADEQUATE SAFEGUARD.
<F5>
WEDNESDAY 17 SEPTEMBER 1980
"TURKEY AFTER THE COUP"
ANOTHER MILITARY JUNTA WOULD SEEM TO BE
ONE OF THE LAST THINGS THE WORLD NEEDS. IN
TURKEY'S CASE, HOWEVER, THE PEACEFUL COUP WHICH
PUT THE ARMY IN CONTROL OF ANKARA LATE LAST WEEK
HAS BROUGHT RELIEF TO MANY TURKS AND TO THE
WESTERN ALLIANCE. THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THE
NEW HEAD OF STATE, GENERAL EVREN, WHEN HE SAYS
THAT THE STEP WAS TAKEN RELUCTANTLY AND AFTER
MANY WARNINGS. AFTER ALL, A CONSERVATIVE, PRO-
WESTERN JUNTA HAS TAKEN OVER FROM A
CONSERVATIVE, PRO-WESTERN ADMINISTRATION. TWO
PREVIOUS MILITARY INTERVENTIONS, IN 1960 AND 1971,
WERE NOT PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL, AND THE GENERALS
OF 1980 HAVE NO DESIRE TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF
THEIR PREDECESSORS. THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT THEIR
ACTION WILL BE MISINTERPRETED IN THE WEST AND
PARTICULARLY IN THE SOVIET UNION, WHOSE BLACK
SEA FLEET IS DEPENDENT ON THE DARDANELLES
PASSAGE AND WHOSE CAUCASIAN ARMY HAS BEEN
BUILT UP TO 15 DIVISIONS.
WHATEVER THE WORLD MAY READ INTO THE COUP,
IT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT A PERIOD OF MILITARY
RULE IS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO ANARCHY AND
PERHAPS CIVIL WAR. THE GENERALS ARE MOSTLY
PRUDENT MEN WHOSE ANNOUNCED AIM IS TO
REVITALISE DEMOCRACY, NOT TO HARM IT. THEY HAVE
SEEN 5000 PEOPLE KILLED IN FIVE YEARS BY THE
TERRORISTS. DESPITE MARTIAL LAW IN MANY PROVINCES,
THE ARMY HAS FELT HAMSTRUNG BY POLITICAL
INDECISION AND VACILLATION. DOZENS OF IDEOLOGIES
AND CAUSES COMPETE VIOLENTLY FOR NATIONAL
ATTENTION. THEY RANGE FROM KURDISH SEPARATISTS
AND ISLAMIC REVIVALISTS TO A HOST OF COMMUNIST
GROUPS AND FANATICAL NATIONALISTS WHO COULD WEAR
A SWASTIKA WITHOUT BLUSHING. ALL FEED OFF
TURKEY'S ECONOMIC CHAOS WITH ITS 100 PER CENT
INFLATION AND UP TO 25 PER CENT UNEMPLOYMENT.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE IS SO SCARCE THAT AN OLD TURKISH
SAYING "A CUP OF COFFEE DESERVES 40 YEARS OF
FRIENDSHIP", HAS NEVER BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE
THAN TODAY.
IF THE POLITICAL LEADERS ARE SEALED IN MOTEL
ROOMS THIS WEEK, THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC
PLANNERS ARE STILL HARD AT WORK ON THE DRACONIAN
REFORMS INTRODUCED EARLY THIS YEAR TO STAVE OFF
BANKRUPTCY. TURKISH FINANCIAL OFFICIALS ARE
HAUNTING WESTERN BANKERS, TRYING TO RESCHEDULE
THEIR ALREADY RESCHEDULED LOAN REPAYMENTS. TO
KEEP FOREIGN AID FLOWING, THE GENERALS ARE
TIGHTENING THEIR SAM BROWNES IN FRONT OF THE TV
CAMERAS. AND IF A 70 PER CENT PAY RISE FOR
STRIKING WORKERS SEEMS A DRAMATIC CONTRADICTION,
THE NEW WAGE STILL FALLS FAR SHORT OF THE COST OF
LIVING. THE JUNTA KNOW THAT THE BATTLE AGAINST
TERRORISM CANNOT BE WON WITHOUT A CONTENTED
WORKFORCE, MORE PRODUCTIVITY AND MORE JOBS,
THUS CHEATING THE EXTREMISTS OF THEIR RECRUITS.
AN IMMEDIATE TASK IS TO MAINTAIN THE CALM SINCE
THE COUP. THE ARMY HAS BEEN A DE FACTO POLICE
FORCE FOR MONTHS, BUT IT WILL NOW BE ABLE TO EXERT
AN AUTHORITY SO CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT IN THE
CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT.
PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN PARALYSED SINCE APRIL.
THE POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN SQUABBLING AMONG
THEMSELVES, EXPENDING THEIR ENERGIES ON
TRADITIONAL RIVALRIES. WHILE MOST OF THE PARTIES
SHARE A SENSE OF OUTRAGE AT THE COUNTRY'S
ANARCHY, THERE IS TOTAL DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT
SHOULD BE DONE TO RESTORE CONTROL. THE ARMY HAS
NOW RELIEVED THEM OF THAT DEBATE, AT LEAST UNTIL
THE WEAK PARTIES OF THE POLITICAL CENTRE CAN
REBUILD THEMSELVES. NEITHER OF THE TWO MAJOR
PARTIES HAS PROVED STRONG ENOUGH TO RULE WITHOUT
THE HELP - AND HINDRANCE - OF SMALLER PARTIES.
THE GENERALS HAVE LONG ADVOCATED A "GRAND
COALITION OF NATIONAL SALVATION" BETWEEN MR
DEMIREL'S JUSTICE PARTY AND MR ECEVIT'S
REPUBLICAN PEOPLE'S PARTY. BUT REPEATED
WARNINGS FROM THE MILITARY FAILED TO PRODUCE A
SHOW OF RESOLVE. UNTIL THE POLITICIANS SEEM
WILLING AND ABLE TO DO THEIR JOBS, THE MILITARY
WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNABLE TO DO ITS JOB: DEFEND
TURKEY, AND THAT MEANS THE WESTERN ALLIANCE AS
WELL, IN A REGION WHERE NATO, THE SOVIET UNION
AND ISLAMIC FERVOR MEET FACE TO FACE.
A RETURN TO CIVILIAN RULE APPEARS TO BE AT
LEAST A YEAR OR TWO AWAY. IN THE PAST 20 YEARS,
THE ARMY HAS TWICE HANDED BACK THE REINS TO
CIVILIANS. BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A DANGER THAT ONE
DAY THE SOLDIERS WILL DEVELOP A TASTE FOR POWER.
IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE JUNTA WILL EXERCISE ITS
AUTHORITY WITH CARE AND A COMPASSION NOT ALWAYS
APPARENT IN THE MARTIAL LAW PROVINCES BEFORE THE
COUP. INDEED, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, THE HUMAN
RIGHTS ORGANISATION, BELIEVES THAT MALTREATMENT
AND TORTURE HAVE BEEN WIDESPREAD AND
SYSTEMATIC. IF THE GENERALS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT DEMOCRACY, THEY WILL PUT A STOP TO SUCH
ATROCITIES. AND THEY WILL NOT HOLD POWER ONE DAY
LONGER THAN NECESSARY TO GET TURKEY BACK ON ITS
FEET.

SATURDAY 20 SEPTEMBER 1980
"'THE AGE' AND THIS ELECTION"
IT IS A NEWSPAPER CONVENTION, AT ELECTION
TIMES, TO DISCUSS AS THE CAMPAIGN UNFOLDS
THE ISSUES BEFORE THE VOTERS, AND THEN, ON THE
MORNING OF THE POLL, FINALLY TO REVEAL THE IDENTITY
OF THE NEWSPAPER'S PREFERRED PARTY. WE DO NOT
INTEND TO FOLLOW THIS CONVENTION IN 1980. AT THE
END OF THIS CAMPAIGN, 'THE AGE' DOES NOT
PROPOSE TO TELL THE READERS HOW TO VOTE.
AUSTRALIA, IT SEEMS TO US, IS AT A PARTICULARLY
CRITICAL POINT IN ITS HISTORY. BUT THE
EXTRAORDINARY FACT IS THAT THE POLITICIANS AND
MOST OF THE VOTERS ARE BEHAVING AND TALKING AS
IF, APART FROM A FEW TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OF
ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT, THE
COUNTRY CAN CARRY ON AFTER THE ELECTION MORE OR
LESS AS USUAL, WHOEVER WINS.
THIS ATTITUDE STRIKES US AS ALARMINGLY
COMPLACENT. TO BEGIN WITH, IT ASSUMES THAT THE
FUTURE OF AUSTRALIA IS ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF
AUSTRALIANS. THE TYRANNY OF DISTANCE, THE PHRASE
INVENTED BY PROFESSOR BLAINEY TO DESCRIBE THE
SYSTEM OF NECESSITY GOVERNING AUSTRALIAN
HISTORY, SEEMS TO OBSCURE FROM LOCAL VIEW THE
MASSIVE SHIFTS OF POWER NOW IN TRAIN TO THE
NORTH. WHICH OF OUR WOULD-BE LEADERS IS
DISCUSSING THE VAST IMPLICATIONS FOR THIS COUNTRY
OF THE EMBRYONIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE 900
MILLION PEOPLE OF CHINA AND THE WORLD-BEATING
TECHNOLOGY OF JAPAN?
NEARER HOME, WHO HAS A REMEDY WHEREBY
AUSTRALIA CAN GET THROUGH THE COMING YEARS
WITHOUT THE CONSTITUTION AGAIN BLOWING UP IN
OUR FACES, AS IT BLEW UP IN 1975? HOW IS THE
COMING RESOURCES BOOM TO BE TACKLED? IN A
COUNTRY OF A MERE 14 MILLION, ARE KEY DECISIONS
REALLY TO BE LEFT TO SIX INDIVIDUAL STATES? THE
WAY THE NEXT GOVERNMENT HANDLES THE WHOLE
COMPLICATED PROBLEM OF OUR RESOURCES WILL
SURELY DECIDE AUSTRALIA'S DEVELOPMENT OVER AT
LEAST THE NEXT DECADE.
HAS EITHER PARTY GIVEN THESE MATTERS
SERIOUS ATTENTION? THERE IS LITTLE SIGN OF IT. IS
THERE A COHERENT DEFENCE POLICY IN CANBERRA?
DOES EITHER PARTY HAVE A FOREIGN POLICY? WHAT
IS OUR MIGRATION POLICY INTENDED TO ACHIEVE? OR
TAKE A MORE PRESSING AND FRIGHTENING PROBLEM:
HAS EITHER PARTY GOT ANY IDEA WHAT TO DO ABOUT
THE HEROIN TRADE, WHICH THE POLICE SAY IS WORTH
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR?
A LARGE PART OF THE POLITICS OF A MODERN
DEMOCRATIC STATE IS CONCERNED WITH THE
DISTRIBUTION OF THE NATIONAL WEALTH: AND
PARTICULARLY WITH THE CLAIMS OF THE UNDER-
PRIVILEGED. WHO AMONG THE POLITICIANS, EVEN AT
A TIME OF VERY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, WHICH IS
LIKELY TO PERSIST, AND OF A GROWING ARMY OF POOR,
IS PUBLICLY DISCUSSING THE SOCIAL AND MORAL
PRINCIPLES BY WHICH THESE CLAIMS OUGHT TO BE
RESOLVED?
AT ANY TIME, ONE OF THE MAIN JOBS OF A
NEWSPAPER THAT SEEKS TO BE USEFUL IS TO DEFINE
THE ISSUES. WE THINK THAT 'THE AGE', AT THIS
ELECTION, WILL BE MOST USEFUL TO ITS READERS IF IT
CONCENTRATES ON THIS JOB. BY STATING OUR
INTENTIONS NOW, WE HOPE THAT READERS OF ALL
POLITICAL LEANINGS WILL TAKE OUR ATTACK ON THE
ISSUES MORE SERIOUSLY THAN IF THEY SUSPECTED
THAT WE WERE RAISING THEM AS A PRELUDE TO
DECLARING AN ALREADY DECIDED PARTY PREFERENCE.
IN AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN, POLITICIANS DENY
THAT THEY HAVE SHORTCOMINGS, AND THEN PROMISE
TO CORRECT THEM. FAR FROM SHARPENING THE
CHOICES IN THE SUPERMARKET OF PUBLIC POLICY AND
LEADERSHIP, THE CAMPAIGN OFTEN OBSCURES THEM.
THE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION BEHAVE LIKE
SWORN ENEMIES OVERTAKEN BY DANGER: THEY
HUDDLE TOGETHER FOR PROTECTION, CURSING. RARELY
IS AN OPPOSITION AS DANGEROUS AS A GOVERNMENT
PRETENDS; NEVER HAS A GOVERNMENT LIVED UP TO
ITS OWN PUBLICITY.
SOME PEOPLE WHO RECOGNISE THIS POINT
GO ON TO DRAW THE BLEAK CONCLUSION
THAT AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN IS AN EXPENSIVE
DIVERSION WE COULD DO WITHOUT. THIS CONCLUSION
IS QUITE MISPLACED. WHATEVER ITS SHORTCOMINGS
AS A FORUM FOR TRUTH AND CANDOR, THE CAMPAIGN
REMAINS OUR CHANCE TO COMPARE. THE CAMPAIGN
IS IRRELEVANT ONLY IF A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT
WOULD BE IRRELEVANT. THERE ARE A THOUSAND THINGS
UNDONE IN OUR SOCIETY FOR WHICH THE FIRST STEP
CAN BE TAKEN ONLY IN CANBERRA. THE CAMPAIGN
IS A MESSY WAY TO FASHION PRIORITIES, BUT IT IS-
LIKE DEMOCRACY ITSELF - PREFERABLE TO EVERY
OTHER WAY. IT IS EASY TO CRITICISE ELECTION
CAMPAIGNS; THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO IMPROVE
THEM.
IT IS OUT OF AN EARNEST DESIRE TO IMPROVE THE
CAMPAIGN, AND NOT OUT OF SOME SORT OF WEARIED
CYNICISM, THAT 'THE AGE' HAS DECIDED TO REMAIN
NEUTRAL IN ITS EDITORIAL OPINION, AND TO SAY SO
NOW. THIS IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE STANCE FOR EVERY
CAMPAIGN; INDEED, EVENTS MAY YET MAKE IT
INAPPROPRIATE FOR THIS ONE. AS THINGS STAND,
HOWEVER, AWAITING THE POLICY SPEECHES, THIS LOOKS
LIKE AN ELECTION ABOUT MANAGEMENT, NOT
IDEOLOGY. THE IMPORTANT ISSUES ARE COMPLEX. IN
A NUMBER OF AREAS, THE PROPER ACTION CAN BE
TAKEN ONLY AT THE COST OF HARMING SECTIONAL
INTERESTS. OUR DECISION NOT TO ENDORSE A PARTY
DOES NOT REFLECT LACK OF INTEREST IN THE ELECTION,
BUT A VERY STRONG CONCERN FOR THE CAMPAIGN. WE
WANT TO HOLD OUR LEADERS' FEET TO THE FIRE.
ACCORDINGLY, 'THE AGE' WILL, OVER THE NEXT
FEW DAYS, ADDRESS QUESTIONS TO BOTH SIDES. WE
SHALL DO OUR BEST TO CUT THROUGH THE WRAPPING
AND DISCOVER WHAT IS ACTUALLY INSIDE THE
PACKAGE. WE DO NOT IMAGINE THAT THIS WILL BE
EASY. THESE DAYS POLITICS IS MORE THAN EVER AN
EXERCISE IN EVASION. WE SHALL DO OUR BEST.
OUR TASK, WE BELIEVE, WOULD BE MADE VERY
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT WERE WE TO HAVE MADE -
OR TO BE MAKING - A CHOICE OF WHO TO
RECOMMEND. IN ANY CASE, A NEWSPAPER HAS NO
VOTE. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN CONTRIBUTE, THE
CAMPAIGN IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ELECTION.
WE WANT TO HAVE, ABSOLUTELY TO THE MAXIMUM,
CLEAR STATEMENTS ON THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. WHERE
WE FAIL TO GET THEM, WE SHALL SAY SO,
UNMISTAKEABLY.
IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT WE ARE PLACING
ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH TRUST IN THE POWER OF PLAIN
WORDS. WHERE LIES THE GAIN IN EXTRACTING A
PROMISE FROM A POLITICIAN? WE NEED TURN BACK
ONLY A LITTLE WAY INTO AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL HISTORY
TO FIND UNEQUIVOCAL COMMITMENTS, UNEQUIVOCALLY
BROKEN. BUT THIS IS PRECISELY THE POINT. A BROKEN
PROMISE IS A MARK AGAINST A POLITICIAN, A PIECE
OF EVIDENCE TO BE USED IN FORMING A JUDGMENT
ABOUT HIS FITNESS TO SERVE. TOO MANY BROKEN
PROMISES, AND YOU KICK HIM OUT. NEVERTHELESS, IT
IS FAR MORE CONDUCIVE TO GOOD GOVERNMENT THAT
A POLITICIAN MAKE A COMMITMENT AND BREAK IT,
THAN THAT HE BE ALLOWED TO MAKE NO
COMMITMENTS AT ALL. IN MODERN CAMPAIGNING,
WITH ITS TELEVISUAL EMPHASIS ON THE QUICK AND THE
SLICK, IT IS FAR TOO EASY FOR POLITICIANS TO AVOID
THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. THEY WON'T GET PAST OURS
WITHOUT US NOTICING.
IN MONDAY'S PAPER, ACCORDINGLY, WE SHALL
BEGIN TO RAISE THE ISSUES THAT WE TAKE TO BE
CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY.
<F7>
"THE ECONOMY NEEDS MEDICINE, NOT FUDGE"
TUESDAY 23 SEPTEMBER 1980
"THE ISSUES (2)"
WHEN POLITICIANS ARE AT THEIR MOST CONFUSING,
THE ISSUES ARE OFTEN CLEAREST. SO IT IS WITH
THE 1980 ELECTION DEBATE OVER ECONOMIC
MANAGEMENT, AN AREA OF POLICY WHERE THE CHOICES
ARE TOUGHEST AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE TEMPTATION
TO SCUTTLE AWAY BEHIND A CLOUD OF FUSS AND JARGON
IS GREATEST. THE QUESTIONS A VOTER NEEDS
ANSWERED IN ORDER TO MAKE AN INFORMED
JUDGMENT BETWEEN THE RIVALS' CLAIMS TO THE
TREASURY BENCHES ARE REMARKABLY FEW.
REMARKABLY FEW, AND REMARKABLY TOUGH. WE ARE
NOT AT ALL SURE THE ELECTORATE WILL SEE THEM
ANSWERED IN WHAT SEEMS LIKELY TO BE A HARD-
FOUGHT AND MISLEADING CAMPAIGN, BUT WE SHALL
ASK THEM IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH AT LEAST WHO IS THE
GREATER PREVARICATOR. WE DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE
THE DIFFICULTY OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT - IT HAS
BEEN THE DISASTER GROUND FOR MOST GOVERNMENTS
IN THE SEVENTIES - BUT WE COULD IMAGINE FEW
THINGS WORSE FOR THE NATION THAN AN ELECTION
CAMPAIGN CONDUCTED ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT
BECAUSE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT IS SO DIFFICULT WE
SHOULD NOT EXPECT TOO MUCH OF OUR POLITICIANS, OR
THEIR PROMISES.
AT THE OUTSET OF THE EIGHTIES, AUSTRALIA FACES
TWO ISSUES OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT THAT
OVERSHADOW THE REST. THE FIRST IS WHETHER WE
OUGHT TO TRY TO HAVE A LITTLE LESS UNEMPLOYMENT
IN RETURN FOR RISKING A LITTLE MORE INFLATION. THE
SECOND IS WHETHER WE SHOULD TRY TO REDUCE THE
WHOLE RANGE OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS IN THE
ECONOMY, EVEN WHERE THIS WOULD FORCE SOME
FIRMS, AND EVEN INDUSTRIES, TO SHUT THEIR DOORS
AND PUT THEIR WORKERS ON THE STREETS. BROADLY
SPEAKING, THE FIRST IS THE KEY ISSUE FOR THE
CLASSIC ECONOMIC INSTRUMENTS - THE BUDGET,
INTEREST RATES, THE EXCHANGE RATE. THE SECOND IS
THE KEY TO HOW THE GOVERNMENT INFLUENCES THE
PATTERN OF OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND
WHETHER IT RESISTS CHANGE OR PROMOTES IT. YOU
WILL NOT GET AN ANSWER TO EITHER BY LOOKING AT
THE RHETORIC.
YOU COULD SAY THE FEDERAL COALITION IS
MORE WORRIED ABOUT INFLATION, AND LABOR ABOUT
UNEMPLOYMENT, BUT THAT HARDLY TAKES US FAR
TOWARDS AN ANSWER TO OUR FIRST QUESTION. THE
GOVERNMENT WOULD NO DOUBT SAY THAT THE
ECONOMY GREW OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AS RAPIDLY
AS WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOAL OF BEARING
DOWN ON INFLATION. BUT ON THE L-NCP'S OWN
REASONING, IF IT HAD BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL IN
CUTTING BACK THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT OVER THOSE
FIVE YEARS, WE WOULD BE IN HEALTHIER SHAPE -
THAT IS, READY TO GROW EVEN FASTER AND THEREBY
HAVE LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT. AND HERE, MR
FRASER'S "SMALL GOVERNMENT" RHETORIC IS EXPOSED
BY THE COLD PRINT OF HIS LAST BUDGET. THIS
DOCUMENT PREDICTS THAT IN 1980-81 BUDGET
REVENUES WILL REACH 26.7 PER CENT OF GROSS
DOMESTIC PRODUCT, COMPARED TO THE LABOR
GOVERNMENT'S PEAK OF 25.1 PER CENT IN 1975-76.
THE GOVERNMENT IS CORRECT IN EMPHASISING
THE IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING THE BUDGET DEFICIT
UNDER CONTROL, BUT QUITE AT ODDS WITH ITS OWN
RHETORIC WHEN IT DOES THAT BY INCREASING ITS TAX
SLUG INSTEAD OF BY PARING ITS OUTGOINGS. THE
OPPOSITION, ON THE OTHER HAND, DOESN'T SEEM TO
THINK THE DEFICIT IS VERY IMPORTANT AT ALL. IT HAS,
BASICALLY, TWO ANSWERS TO THE CONCERN THAT ITS
PLANS TO SPEND MORE MONEY WILL SET OFF MORE
INFLATION: FIRST, THAT IT WILL HELP PAY FOR ITS
OUTGOINGS BY A RESOURCES TAX AND TIGHTENING UP
ON TAX DODGING AND, SECOND, THAT IT WILL ACHIEVE
SOME KIND OF "SOCIAL COMPACT" WITH TRADE UNIONS.
ONLY AN OPTIMIST WOULD BE REASSURED ON EITHER
COUNT. UNTIL WE SEE A CLEARER CASE TO THE
CONTRARY, WE ARE OBLIGED TO ASSUME THAT LABOR'S
PROGRAMME WOULD INDEED RISK HIGHER INFLATION
FOR WHATEVER GAINS IT MAKES AGAINST
UNEMPLOYMENT.
WHAT DOES THIS ADD UP TO? IN OUR VIEW,
MR FRASER SHOULD STOP PRETENDING HE IS A
SMALL-GOVERNMENT MAN, FOR HE IS NOT. HE IS A
SMALL-DEFICIT MAN, AND THAT IS SOMETHING QUITE
DIFFERENT, BECAUSE IT PROCEEDS FROM A FLUKE
DIVIDEND PAID BY THE MOTORIST AT THE PETROL
PUMP, NOT THE HARD SLOG OF THE TRUE PARER OF
GOVERNMENT, WHO HAS TO TAKE THINGS AWAY
FROM PEOPLE. WE BELIEVE THE DEBATE ON
INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT WOULD BE VERY
GREATLY ASSISTED, ALSO, BY SOME CLEAR
ACCOUNTING FROM THE OPPOSITION OF THE IMPACT
ON INFLATION OF WHAT THEY PROPOSE. OF COURSE,
WE ARE PLEASED TO HEAR THE OPPOSITION ASSERT
THAT IT CAN CUT UNEMPLOYMENT; BUT ONLY WHEN
WE KNOW THE INFLATIONARY COST OF THAT CAN WE
DECIDE WHETHER IT IS WORTHWHILE.
ON GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, THE L-NCP HAS
LEFT IT A BIT LATE IN THE DAY TO CLAIM CREDIBLY IT
STANDS FOR FREE ENTERPRISE. WE SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT THE CONTROLS ON BANK INTEREST
RATES WHICH HAVE CAUSED THE GOVERNMENT'S
OWN ECONOMIC ADVISERS SUCH GREAT (AND
ACKNOWLEDGED) CONCERN WOULD, ALONE, PUT THE
L-NCP FIRMLY IN THE TRADITION OF THE GREAT
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTIES OF THE WORLD. THIS
GOVERNMENT ALSO STANDS FOR QUOTAS - NOT EVEN
TARIFFS, BUT QUOTAS - ON A RANGE OF SENSITIVE
IMPORTS. IT STANDS FOR THE TWO-AIRLINE
AGREEMENT. IT SUBSIDISES THINGS, ESPECIALLY FOR
ITS RURAL FRIENDS. AND, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE
FUTURE, IT IS THE L-NCP THAT HAS THE NOTORIOUS
RECORD IN AUSTRALIAN POST-WAR HISTORY FOR
MANIPULATING THE EXCHANGE RATE.
IN THIS ELECTION, THE CHOICE BETWEEN
SOCIALISM AND FREE ENTERPRISE IS ONLY A MATTER
OF DEGREE, AND A PRECIOUS SMALL DEGREE AT THAT.
YET WE MUST NOT PERMIT OUR SCEPTICISM OVER
THAT TO BLIND US TO THE IMPORTANCE OF
GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION. IT IS TRULY A KEY
QUESTION FOR THE EIGHTIES. IF ONLY A PART OF THE
RESOURCES INVESTMENTS THIS GOVERNMENT IS
CROWING ABOUT ACTUALLY OCCURS, THE AUSTRALIAN
ECONOMY WILL BE PUT UNDER SEVERE STRAIN. WE
SHOULD HEAR FROM THE L-NCP NO MORE CROWING
ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THE BOOM UNTIL WE HAVE
HEARD A CONVINCING ACCOUNT OF HOW THEY
PLAN TO GO ABOUT DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS.
THEY SHOULD TELL US, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HOW
FAR THEY WOULD TRY TO FILL THE BOOM JOBS WITH
AUSTRALIANS WHO WANT WORK, AND HOW FAR THEY
WOULD RELY ON IMMIGRANTS.
FROM THE LABOR PARTY, WE SHOULD HEAR THE
GOSPEL OF PROTECTIONISM IN ITS AUTHORISED
VERSION, NOT THE PATCH-AND-STITCH RESPONSE WE
GET, DEPENDING ON WHOM WE LISTEN TO AND
WHICH AUDIENCE THEY ARE ADDRESSING. WOULD THE
LABOR PARTY INCREASE PROTECTION? - THE BALANCE
OF FORCES INSIDE THE PARTY SUGGEST SO. IN THAT
CASE, WE NEED A CONVINCING ACCOUNT FROM LABOR
OF WHAT IT SEES AS THE COSTS OF THAT - WHICH
WILL FALL ON THE EFFICIENT INDUSTRIES - AND WHAT
IT INTENDS TO DO ABOUT THEM.
HERE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE WANT THE
CONTENDERS TO ANSWER ON ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT.
IS THERE A PROSPECT OF A SUBSTANTIAL
REDUCTION IN UMEMPLOYMENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE
YEARS? IF SO, HOW MIGHT IT BE ACHIEVED?
SHOULD IT BE AN OBJECTIVE OF AUSTRALIAN
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT TO KEEP INFLATION LOWER
THAN THE OECD AVERAGE?
ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF A SUBSTANTIAL DECONTROL
OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING BANK INTEREST
RATES? WOULD YOU THEN COUNTENANCE INTEREST
RATES IN THE TEENS, IF MONETARY MANAGEMENT
REQUIRED THEM.
DO YOU EXPECT THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR TO
STRENGTHEN DURING THE EIGHTIES UNDER YOUR
ADMINISTRATION? OUGHT IT TO BE ALLOWED TO?
TOMORROW WE SHALL DISCUSS FOREIGN AFFAIRS
AND DEFENCE.
<F8>
THURSDAY 25 SEPTEMBER 1980
"POVERTY IN A LAND OF PLENTY"
"THE ISSUES (4)"
RICH IN RESOURCES, AUSTRALIA IS INDEED A
LUCKY COUNTRY. HOW AND WHEN THESE
RESOURCES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED IS PERHAPS THE
BIGGEST DOMESTIC CHALLENGE FACING NATIONAL
GOVERNMENT IN THE 1980S. ANOTHER CHALLENGE,
AS IMPORTANT BUT MORE DIFFICULT TO MEET, IS
TO ENSURE THAT AUSTRALIA'S GOOD FORTUNE IS
EQUITABLY SHARED.
HISTORY SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT THIS SHOULD
NOT BE HARD. AFTER ALL, AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL
TRADITION ENSHRINES THE PRINCIPLE OF THE "FAIR
GO", THE IDEAL THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS ARE ENTITLED
TO A DECENT STANDARD OF LIVING, AND AN
ACCEPTANCE THAT GOVERNMENTS SHOULD INTERVENE
TO HELP THOSE SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, BE
THEY MANUFACTURERS, FARMERS OR WORKERS, WHO
EXPERIENCE ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE. BUT TIMES
HAVE CHANGED AND ATTITUDES HAVE HARDENED.
SOME 25 YEARS OF RAPIDLY RISING LIVING STANDARDS
FOR THE MAJORITY AND POPULAR EXPECTATIONS HAVE
LEFT AUSTRALIANS ILL-PREPARED FOR THE RAVAGES OF
INFLATION AND RECESSION. AT THE VERY TIME THAT
UNEMPLOYMENT GROWTH AND SOCIAL CHANGES HAVE
WIDENED THE GAP BETWEEN THE HAVES AND
HAVE-NOTS, CONCERN FOR THE DEPRIVED AND
DISADVANTAGED IS DIMINISHING. THOSE WHO HAVE
PROSPERED IN THE GOOD YEARS, OR PROFITED FROM
INFLATION, WANT TO KEEP WHAT THEY WON, AND TO
GAIN MORE. THEY RESENT SUGGESTIONS THAT THEY
SHOULD RESTRAIN THEIR QUEST FOR HIGHER INCOMES
IN ORDER TO SAVE JOBS, OR THAT THEY SHOULD PAY
MORE IN TAXATION TO HELP THOSE WITHOUT JOBS.
THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN BEHIND IN THE BAD YEARS
ARE GROWING IN NUMBER, BUT NOT, IT SEEMS, IN
INFLUENCE. THEY ARE THE VICTIMS NOT ONLY OF HARD
TIMES BUT OF HARD-HEARTEDNESS.
THE POLITICIANS HAVE BECOME INFECTED BY
THE MOOD OF MEANNESS PREVAILING AMONG THE
FORTUNATE MAJORITY OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS. MISSING
FROM THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN SO FAR IS ANY
STRONG APPEAL BY EITHER OF THE MAIN PARTIES TO
IDEALISM OR COMPASSION. THERE MAY BE THE ODD
FLIGHT OF RHETORIC, BUT POLICIES ARE MORE
SHREWDLY DIRECTED TO VOTERS' SELF-INTEREST. THE
GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN REFUGE IN AN EMPHASIS ON
THE NEED FOR ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY. THIS MAY
WELL BE A VALID CONSTRAINT ON THE SIZE OF THE
BUDGET DEFICIT, BUT MUCH LESS SO ON THE ROLE OF
THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND HARDLY AT ALL ON HOW THE
WELFARE CAKE SHOULD BE DIVIDED. LABOR'S
TRADITIONAL CONCERN FOR THE UNDER-DOG HAS BEEN
MUTED BY PERCEIVED ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL
CONSTRAINTS, AND BY THE CALCULATION, BORN OF
EXPERIENCE, THAT OFFERS OF TAX CUTS WILL ATTRACT
MORE VOTES THAN PROMISES OF AID FOR THE
UNEMPLOYED, ALTHOUGH THE UNEMPLOYED HAVE NOT
BEEN FORGOTTEN. NEITHER PARTY HAS EVEN BEGUN
TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE POSSIBLE IRREPARABLE
DAMAGE BEING INFLICTED BY SOCIETY ON OUR
UNEMPLOYED YOUTH.
THE REALITY THAT NEITHER THE PARTIES NOR THE
ELECTORATE CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE IS THE APPALLING
FACT THAT SOME TWO MILLION AUSTRALIANS ARE
LIVING ON OR BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. BY
CIVILISED STANDARDS, THE POVERTY LINE HAS BEEN
AUSTERELY DRAWN, AND SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE
THAT AS MANY AS 2.5 MILLION AUSTRALIANS NOW
LIVE IN POVERTY, OR ON THE BRINK. THEY INCLUDE
THE JOBLESS, MANY AGED AND INVALID PENSIONERS,
SINGLE PARENTS, AND THEIR DEPENDENT CHILDREN.
MANY ARE DOUBLY HANDICAPPED BY BEING BLACK,
OR IMMIGRANT, OR LIMITED IN SKILLS AND
EDUCATION. THE PROBLEM IS NOT SIMPLY A
TEMPORARY REFLECTION OF RECESSION AND
DEFLATIONARY POLICIES. TECHNOLOGICAL AND
STRUCTURAL CHANGES WILL MEAN A LASTING HIGHER
LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND A GREATER NUMBER OF
UNEMPLOYABLES. AN AGEING POPULATION MEANS A
GROWING NUMBER OF WELFARE DEPENDANTS, WHO
ALREADY REPRESENT ONE AUSTRALIAN IN FIVE. THESE
TRENDS, AS WELL AS COMMON HUMANITY, DEMAND
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN ATTITUDES AND
APPROACH.
THE GROWING CLAIMS ON WELFARE, AND ITS
RISING COST, HAVE MADE PUBLIC AND POLITICIANS
ALIKE WARY OF MOVING FURTHER TOWARDS AN
ALL-EMBRACING WELFARE STATE. THE LIBERALS HAVE
NEVER FAVORED THIS APPROACH, ALTHOUGH THE
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN LESS EFFECTIVE IN
RESTRAINING SOCIAL SECURITY OUTLAYS THAN SOME
OF ITS HARDER-LINE SUPPORTERS WOULD WISH. THE
LABOR PARTY HAS SEVERELY MODIFIED ITS FORMER
FAITH IN UNIVERSAL SCHEMES. BOTH SIDES NOW
AGREE THAT WELFARE SPENDING SHOULD BE BASED ON
NEEDS. YET, WHILE REAL NEED IS WIDESPREAD AND
DEMONSTRABLE, IT IS NOT BEING ADEQUATELY MET.
MANY PENSIONS AND ALLOWANCES ARE STILL WELL
BELOW THE MINIMUM REQUIRED FOR A DECENT
LIVING. THE SOCIAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT, IN A
VIRTUAL ADMISSION THAT THEIR PAYMENTS ARE
INADEQUATE, IS REFERRING MORE AND MORE
DESPERATE PEOPLE TO EMERGENCY RELIEF AGENCIES,
WHOSE FUNDS ARE NEARLY EXHAUSTED. AND THIS
IN A LAND OF PLENTY.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS YET TO REVEAL WHAT NEW
INITIATIVES, IF ANY, IT WILL TAKE TO REDUCE
POVERTY AND COMPENSATE THE VICTIMS OF ITS
ANTI-INFLATIONARY STRATEGY. ITS RECORD, DESPITE THE
EFFORTS OF DAME MARGARET GUILFOYLE TO SUSTAIN
THE WELFARE BUDGET, IS ONE OF ATTRITION IN THE
REAL VALUE OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. IN SOME
- SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR THOSE
UNDER 18 - THERE HAS BEEN NO INCREASE AT ALL
SINCE 1975. WELFARE HOUSING FUNDS HAVE BEEN
SAVAGELY REDUCED AT A TIME WHEN NEEDS ARE
GROWING. LABOR HAS PROPOSED A FAMILY
ASSISTANCE PLAN WHICH, DESPITE SOME ANOMALIES,
IS TAILORED TO HELP THOSE MOST IN NEED. IT HAS
FEW OTHER WELFARE COMMITMENTS OTHER THAN A
SIGNIFICANT BOOST FOR WELFARE HOUSING (AS PART OF
A $150 MILLION A YEAR PROGRAMME TO REVIVE THE
DEPRESSED HOUSING INDUSTRY). THE FIRST STEP
TOWARDS SOCIAL JUSTICE SHOULD BE TO RAISE ALL
PENSIONS AND BENEFITS TO THE POVERTY LINE. THIS
HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO COST $500 MILLION IN THE
FIRST YEAR, EQUIVALENT TO ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER
OF THE BOOMING OIL LEVY. IN THE LONGER TERM, THE
CONCEPT OF A GUARANTEED MINIMUM INCOME
SHOULD BE ACCEPTED - AND SET AT A FAIR AND
REASONABLE LEVEL. THE COST NEED NOT BE ENTIRELY
FUNDED BY HIGHER TAXATION; THERE IS SCOPE FOR
REALLOCATING SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS ACCORDING
TO NEED BY MEANS-TESTING FAMILY ALLOWANCES AND
PENSIONS FOR THOSE MORE THAN 70.
ODDLY ENOUGH, HEALTH HAS RETREATED TO THE
BACKGROUND AS AN ELECTION ISSUE, DESPITE THE
GOVERNMENT'S SUCCESSION OF CONFUSING CHANGES
TO THE HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM AND THE RISING
COST OF PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE.
NOTWITHSTANDING MEDIBANK'S SOCIAL EQUITY,
PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE, ADMINISTRATIVE ECONOMY AND
BUILT-IN COST CONSTRAINTS, THE COALITION REJECTS
THE CONCEPT AND LABOR IS CAUTIOUS ABOUT
RESTORING IT. LABOR HAS, AS A START, PROPOSED A
LIMITED FAMILY HEALTH CARE SCHEME TO PROVIDE
FREE MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN
AND STUDENTS. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS
BEGUN TO BEAR DOWN ON HOSPITAL COSTS, NEITHER
SIDE SEEMS WILLING TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THE
UNRESTRAINED COSTS OF A PROLIFERATING MEDICAL
PROFESSION AND AN OPEN-ENDED FEE-FOR-SERVICE
SYSTEM.
EDUCATION ALSO, IN COMPARISON WITH FORMER
YEARS, HAS DIMINISHED AS AN ELECTION ISSUE.
SHORTAGES OF CLASSROOMS AND TEACHERS HAVE BEEN
OVERCOME (WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS); INDEED, THE
PICTURE IS ONE OF DWINDLING ENROLMENTS AND
TEACHER SURPLUSES. PEOPLE HAVE BECOME MORE
CONCERNED WITH THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION
AND REALISE THAT THAT CANNOT SIMPLY BE IMPROVED
BY SPENDING MORE MONEY. DESPITE ITS PROFESSED
DEDICATION TO FEDERALISM, THE GOVERNMENT
CONTINUES TO SUBSIDISE SCHOOLING, WHICH IS
PRIMARILY A STATE RESPONSIBILITY. LABOR WOULD DO
LIKEWISE, BUT ITS FUNDING TO INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS
WOULD BE MORE STRICTLY ON A NEEDS BASIS. THE
COMMONWEALTH HAS ASSUMED FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION; HERE THE TREND IS TOWARDS
ENCOURAGING TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION AT
THE EXPENSE OF UNIVERSITIES. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE
HAS BEEN A SEVERE REDUCTION IN FUNDS FOR BASIC
RESEARCH.
ONE MEASURE OF A CIVILISED COMMUNITY IS ITS
TREATMENT OF MINORITY GROUPS, ESPECIALLY THOSE
WHICH SUFFER DEPRIVATION OR DISCRIMINATION.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS OVER-RIDING
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS, BUT HAS
BEEN RELUCTANT TO INVOKE ITS POWERS AND EXERT
ITS INFLUENCE TO UPHOLD ABORIGINAL RIGHTS AND
INTERESTS AGAINST THE OPPRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OF
STATE GOVERNMENTS OBSESSED WITH MINERAL
EXPLOITATIONS. LABOR SEEMS READIER TO GIVE
ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS PRIORITY OVER THE DEMANDS
OF MINING AND DEVELOPMENT.
ACCORDINGLY, IN THIS THE LAST OF OUR PRESENT
SERIES OF ELECTION EDITORIALS, WE ASK THE
PARTIES:-
WILL YOU TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO RAISE ALL
PENSIONS, BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES TO GIVE
THOSE WHOLLY DEPENDENT ON THEM AN INCOME
EQUIVALENT TO THE POVERTY LINE?
WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE PRINCIPLE OF A GUARANTEED
MINIMUM INCOME TO ENSURE THAT NO AUSTRALIAN
NEED LIVE IN POVERTY, EVEN IF IT MEANS
INCREASED TAXATION OR RESTRUCTURING OF SOCIAL
SECURITY BENEFITS?
DO YOU INTEND TO ESTABLISH, AND IF SO HOW, A
NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME THAT COVERS
EVERYONE, ENSURES THAT THE COSTS ARE EQUITABLY
SHARED, AND RESTRAINS THE OVER-PROVISION OF
HEALTH CARE SERVICES?
WILL YOU DIRECT EDUCATION FUNDING ACCORDING TO
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND SOCIAL PRIORITIES RATHER
THAN POLITICAL PRIORITIES, AND PROVIDE ADEQUATE
FUNDS FOR BASIC RESEARCH?
WILL YOU AGREE TO NEGOTIATE A TREATY WITH
ABORIGINAL REPRESENTATIVES TO SETTLE OUTSTAND-
ING LAND RIGHTS CLAIMS, AGREE ON COMPENSATION
AND USE FEDERAL POWERS TO UPHOLD ABORIGINAL
INTERESTS AGAINST OPPRESSIVE STATE LAWS AND
ACTIONS?
<F9>
FRIDAY 26 SEPTEMBER 1980
"TRANSPORT: THE LONIE FORMULA"
ABOUT A DECADE AGO, A 12-MAN STATE
GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE PROPOSED A $2616
MILLION EXPANSION OF MELBOURNE'S TRANSPORT
SYSTEM. THE COMMITTEE, WHOSE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN
WAS THE THEN MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT,
MR R. J. HAMER, SAID THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS
AN EXTRA 150 KILOMETRES OF RAILWAY LINES WOULD
BE NEEDED BY 1985 TO COPE WITH MELBOURNE'S
GROWING POPULATION. THIS INCLUDED THREE NEW
SUBURBAN ROUTES, EXTENSIONS TO EIGHT EXISTING
LINES, AND AN $80 MILLION UNDERGROUND RAIL LOOP
AROUND THE CITY'S CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT TO
COPE WITH THE PASSENGERS FROM THE NEW LINES.
FOR REASONS THAT REMAIN OBSCURE, THE LOOP WAS
THE ONLY RAIL PROJECT UNDERTAKEN BY THE
GOVERNMENT. NOW, AS IT NEARS COMPLETION, THE
LATEST TRANSPORT INQUIRY HAS RAISED SERIOUS
DOUBTS ABOUT THE LOOP'S USEFULNESS. WHEREAS IN
1970 THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING SUBURBAN
TRAINS WAS EXPECTED TO DOUBLE BY 1985, THE
LATEST INQUIRY HAS FOUND THAT PATRONAGE HAS
DROPPED SO ALARMINGLY THAT EIGHT SUBURBAN RAIL
SERVICES, INCLUDING FIVE THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO
BE SERVED DIRECTLY BY THE UNDERGROUND, SHOULD,
IN THE COMMITTEE'S OPINION, BE SHUT DOWN. IT
RAISES THE SPECTRE OF GHOST TRAINS RATTLING AROUND
AN UNDERGROUND SYSTEM NOW EXPECTED TO COST
$450 MILLION, PLUS BIG INTEREST REPAYMENTS.
THE LATEST INQUIRY WAS UNDERTAKEN BY A
GROUP LED BY A RETIRED BHP EXECUTIVE, MR MURRAY
LONIE, AND THE CHIEF PLANNING ENGINEER OF THE
COUNTRY ROADS BOARD, MR R. UNDERWOOD. IN
A REPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT RELEASED THIS WEEK
THEY RECOMMENDED THE CLOSURE OF RAIL SERVICES
TO ST KILDA, PORT MELBOURNE, SANDRINGHAM,
UPFIELD, ALAMEIN AND HURSTBRIDGE; THE
ABANDONMENT OF SERVICES BEYOND NEWPORT TO
ALTONA AND WILLIAMSTOWN; THE SCRAPPING OF
TRAM SERVICES TO SOUTH MELBOURNE, ST KILDA
BEACH, CAMBERWELL AND MARIBYRNONG; AND THE
ENDING OF MANY NIGHT AND WEEKEND SERVICES.
THE JUSTIFICATION WAS FALLING PATRONAGE AND
LOSSES BY VICRAIL AND THE TRAMWAYS BOARD. TO
MANY PEOPLE, THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE
PREDICTABLE. THE ANNUAL DEFICITS BEING INCURRED
BY THE TWO PUBLIC TRANSPORT AUTHORITIES TOTAL
ABOUT $200 MILLION. THE SIMPLEST WAY TO REDUCE
THAT FIGURE IS TO PRUNE THE LEAST USED SERVICES.
BUT THE SIMPLEST WAYS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST.
THE LONIE REPORT IS SUPERFICIAL AND ITS
RECOMMENDATIONS SHORT-SIGHTED. ITS SUPERFICIALITY
IS NOT SURPRISING. IT IS ONE OF MORE THAN 20 THAT
MR LONIE'S GROUP HAS PREPARED SINCE IT WAS
APPOINTED LAST DECEMBER TO INVESTIGATE EVERY
ASPECT OF TRANSPORT IN VICTORIA. A PROPER
EVALUATION OF MELBOURNE'S PUBLIC TRANSPORT
SYSTEM WOULD TAKE MUCH LONGER THAN THE PERIOD
WHICH THE STUDY GROUP HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO
DEVOTE TO IT. BUT ITS SHORT-SIGHTEDNESS IS LESS
EXCUSABLE. THE AUTHORS OF THE REPORT SEEM TO
HAVE THOUGHT ONLY IN TERM OF DOLLARS AND CENTS.
THE SOCIAL COSTS OF CHOPPING TRAIN AND TRAM
SERVICES TO THE EXTENT PROPOSED IN THE LONIE
REPORT FAR OUTWEIGH THE ANNUAL SAVINGS BY THE
TREASURY. WE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT
GOVERNMENT POLICY WAS TO CONSERVE OIL AND TO
ENCOURAGE DRIVERS TO LEAVE THEIR CARS AT HOME.
MR LONIE SEEMS TO THINK OTHERWISE. HIS
FORMULA FOR CUTTING THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT DEFICIT
IS ALSO A RECIPE FOR INCREASED ROAD CONGESTION,
INCREASED DEMAND FOR EXPENSIVE FREEWAYS, AND A
HIGHER DEMAND FOR OIL. THE REDUCTION OF PUBLIC
TRANSPORT IN INNER SUBURBAN AREAS WOULD ALSO
WORK AGAINST ANOTHER GOVERNMENT POLICY, WHICH
IS TO ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO LIVE AND WORK
CLOSE TO TOWN INSTEAD OF IN THE OUTER SUBURBS.
FORTUNATELY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT
COMMITTED ITSELF TO IMPLEMENTING THE LONIE
REPORTS. PERHAPS THEY WILL JOIN THE DUSTY PILES
OF OTHER TRANSPORT REPORTS COMMISSIONED BY THE
GOVERNMENT IN THE PAST DECADE AND SUBSEQUENTLY
SHELVED. (THE PREVIOUS MELBOURNE TRANSPORT
STUDY, WHICH PROPOSED $1600 MILLION WORTH OF
NEW ROADS, TRAM LINES AND RAIL LINES, WAS
RELEASED SHORTLY BEFORE THE 1979 STATE ELECTION
AND HAS SINCE BEEN FORGOTTEN.) A MORE REALISTIC
AND SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY OF REDUCING THE
PUBLIC TRANSPORT DEFICIT WOULD BE TO RAISE FARES
TO A LEVEL WHERE THEY COME CLOSER TO MATCHING
OPERATING COSTS AND TO REDUCE VICRAIL'S
WORKFORCE. MANPOWER CONSULTANTS TOLD THE
GOVERNMENT IN 1976 THAT MANY THOUSANDS OF
VICRAIL'S STAFF COULD BE SHED WITHOUT AFFECTING
THE STANDARD OF SERVICE. STAFF CUTS, HIGHER FARES,
AND THE JUDICIOUS PRUNING OF ONE OR TWO TRAM
LINES IN AREAS ALREADY SERVED BY TRAINS OR BUSES
WOULD BE MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN MR LONIE'S
PRESCRIPTION.
"BAREFACED PATRONAGE"
BY RIGHTS THE DEFECTION OF VICTORIAN MP MR
NEIL MCINNES TO THE LIBERALS LAST MONTH
SHOULD HAVE ENDED THE NATIONAL PARTY'S OFFICIAL
STATUS AS A PARTY, AND THE PERKS AND PRIVILEGES
THAT GO WITH IT. FOR AS THE LAW THEN STOOD, A
PARTY HAD TO HAVE AT LEAST 12 PARLIAMENTARY
REPRESENTATIVES BEFORE QUALIFYING. THE NATIONAL
PARTY HAD 12 BEFORE MR MCINNES CHANGED
HORSES. HIS DEFECTION REDUCED THE NATIONALS'
STRENGTH TO 11. BEFORE HE MADE HIS MOVE,
HOWEVER, A DEAL WAS DONE WITH THE LIBERALS,
GUARANTEEING THAT IF MR MCINNES DID CHANGE
SIDES, THE NATIONAL PARTY'S STATUS WOULD NOT BE
JEOPARDISED.
IT HASN'T BEEN. IN THE EARLY HOURS OF
YESTERDAY MORNING - A TIME PRESUMABLY CHOSEN
IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID PUBLICITY - THE
GOVERNMENT BROUGHT IN LEGISLATION REDUCING THE
NUMBER REQUIRED FOR LEGAL PARTY STATUS FROM 12
TO 11. THE EFFECT OF THIS PIECE OF BAREFACED
POLITICAL PATRONAGE IS TO GIVE THE NATIONALS THE
USE OF THREE CHAUFFEUR-DRIVEN GOVERNMENT CARS,
OFFICE STAFF AND EQUIPMENT, AND UNLIMITED USE
OF TELEPHONES. IT ALSO QUALIFIES THE NATIONAL
PARTY LEADER, MR ROSS-EDWARDS, AND THREE OTHER
PARTY MEMBERS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER SALARIES.
THE LABOR PARTY, WHICH ENJOYS THE SAME
PRIVILEGES BUT WITH A TOTAL PARLIAMENTARY
STRENGTH OF 45, ESTIMATES THE COST TO THE
TAXPAYER OF THE GOVERNMENT'S MOVE AT $200,000
A YEAR. IN RETURN THE PREMIER, MR HAMER, HAS A
NATIONAL PARTY WHICH IS IN HIS DEBT(AS WELL AS A
WORKING MAJORITY OF THREE INSTEAD OF ONE AS
PREVIOUSLY).
IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT THE ORIGINAL 12-SEAT
REQUIREMENT WAS ARBITRARY ANYWAY, AND THAT
THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON WHY IT SHOULDN'T BE
REDUCED TO 11 SEATS. THAT IS TRUE, EXCEPT THAT
THE CHANGE WAS NOT MADE TO CURE AN ANOMALY.
IT WAS MADE BY THE LIBERALS TO SWEETEN THE
NATIONAL PARTY. MR ROSS-EDWARDS AND HIS
DIMINISHING BAND OF COLLEAGUES MAY DESERVE TO
BE OFFICIALLY CONSIDERED AS A PARTY. BUT THEY
HAVE NO RIGHT TO THEIR TAXPAYER-FUNDED PERKS AND
PRIVILEGES JUST BECAUSE IT SUITS MR HAMER TO
HAVE THEM FEELING GRATEFUL.
A FAIRER WAY OF RESOLVING THE PROBLEM OF
PARTY STATUS WOULD BE TO BASE IT, NOT ON A FIXED
NUMBER OF SEATS AS NOW BUT ON A PERCENTAGE OF
SEATS OR VOTES WON. THUS, A PARTY WHICH
CAPTURED SAY 10 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL SEATS OR
10 PER CENT OF THE PRIMARY VOTES WOULD QUALIFY.
THE FIGURE ITSELF IS ARGUABLE; BUT ONCE ARRIVED
AT, IT SHOULD BE ADHERED TO RIGIDLY. GOVERNMENTS
SHOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN
EXERCISE PATRONAGE TOWARDS OTHER MUCH
SMALLER PARTIES, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT IS THE
TAXPAYER WHO HAS ULTIMATELY TO MEET THE BILL.

MONDAY 29 SEPTEMBER 1980
"MR SCHMIDT OR MR STRAUSS?"
IF THE OPINION POLLS ARE TO BE BELIEVED,
CHANCELLOR SCHMIDT AND HIS RULING COALITION
WILL BE RETURNED TO POWER IN WEST GERMANY
ON 5 OCTOBER. THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE. THE
COUNTRY IS ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY STABLE.
PEOPLE ARE CONTENT. MR SCHMIDT'S ADMINISTRATION
HAS STEERED THROUGH THE SHOALS OF TERRORISM
AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DECLINE AND EMERGED
WITH AN ENVIABLE 5 PER CENT INFLATION RATE AND
FEWER THAN A MILLION UNEMPLOYED. HOWEVER,
WEST GERMANS TEND TO WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE,
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE SINCE THEY LIVE AT THE
FRONT LINE OF EAST-WEST TENSION. THEY NEED TO
FEEL PROTECTED, PARTICULARLY AFTER THE AFGHANISTAN
AFFAIR, WHICH HAS HELPED TO DISTRACT VOTER
ATTENTION FROM DOMESTIC ISSUES.
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION SEEMS TO
BE WHO WILL MAKE THE SAFER CHANCELLOR: MR
SCHMIDT OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, OR MR STRAUSS
WHOSE CHRISTIAN SOCIAL UNION IS ALIGNED IN
OPPOSITION WITH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS. HERE
AGAIN THE OPINION POLLS LEAVE NO DOUBT. THE
INCUMBENT IS WAY AHEAD OF HIS UNPREDICTABLE
BAVARIAN OPPONENT. MR SCHMIDT HAS SHOWN
HIMSELF TO BE THE STRONG, HARD-HEADED LEADER
THE ELECTORATE AS A WHOLE WOULD WISH HIM TO
BE. HE IS PROBABLY THE BEST INFORMED POLITICAL
LEADER IN THE WEST AND PERHAPS THE MOST
INTELLIGENT. HIS PUBLIC IMAGE IS THAT OF THE
SUPREME CRISIS MANAGER, A CONSERVATIVE
PRAGMATIST RATHER THAN A VISIONARY IDEALIST LIKE
HIS PREDECESSOR, MR BRANDT.
MR SCHMIDT IS PERCEIVED AS ESSENTIALLY TO
THE RIGHT OF HIS OWN PARTY. INDEED, THE SIGH
"IF ONLY HE WERE WITH US" IS OFTEN HEARD FROM
THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS. FOR ANYONE IN THE
CENTRE OR LEFT OF CENTRE, MR SCHMIDT IS OBVIOUSLY
PREFERABLE TO THE CONSERVATIVE, EARTHY AND
TOTALLY BAVARIAN MR STRAUSS. THERE IS ALSO A
MARKED NORTH-SOUTH GAP IN CHANCELLOR
PREFERENCE. EVEN THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS IN
THE NORTH PREFER MR SCHMIDT (A HAMBURGER)
TO THE FOLKLORE OF THEIR ADOPTED CANDIDATE.
ONLY ON HIS NATIVE TERRITORY DOES MR STRAUSS
ENJOY A LARGE MAJORITY. ON A RECENT VISIT TO THE
UNITED STATES, MR STRAUSS IS REPORTED TO HAVE
RECOGNISED A KINDREDSHIP OF SPIRIT BETWEEN
TEXANS AND BAVARIANS, AND THE REST OF THE
FEDERAL REPUBLIC WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE,
PLAYING AS THEY DO THE NEW ENGLAND TO MR
STRAUSS'S TEXAS.
BECAUSE THERE APPEAR TO BE SO FEW REAL
DIFFERENCES IN POLICY BETWEEN THE ESTABLISHED
PARTIES, THIS CAMPAIGN HAS PROVED TO BE ONE
OF THE MOST PERSONAL - AND DIRTY - ELECTIONS
IN FEDERAL HISTORY. MR STRAUSS IS IN A REAL
DILEMMA. EVERY ATTEMPT TO MODIFY HIS NATURAL
POPULIST AGGRESSIVENESS, IN ORDER TO APPEAL TO
CIRCLES BEYOND HIS HURRAH TROOPS IN THE ALPS,
ATTRACTS THE ACCUSATION FROM FRIEND AND FOE
ALIKE THAT HE IS SIMPLY IMITATING HELMUT SCHMIDT.
THUS MR STRAUSS HAS YET TO LAY DOWN A REAL
CHALLENGE TO THE CHANCELLOR, WHO UNTIL RECENTLY
HAS PREFERRED TO CAMPAIGN BY NOT CAMPAIGNING,
SEEING MORE ADVANTAGE IN RUNNING BONN THAN
STOOPING TO THE ELECTORAL DEBATE.
NOW, IN THE LAST DAYS BEFORE POLLING, THERE
IS AN INTRIGUING CONTEST TO BE SEEN BETWEEN TWO
CONSUMMATE ORATORS, EACH WITH AN OUTSTANDING
GRASP OF FOREIGN, DEFENCE, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC
AFFAIRS. IN MANY RESPECTS IT IS A PHONEY CONTEST.
WEST GERMANS GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY
HAVE MADE A FIRM CHOICE ALREADY. MR STRAUSS
APPEARS TO BE NEAR THE END OF HIS POLITICAL ROAD.
"OIL: PROGRESS AT A PROFIT"
WITH THE ENERGY CRISES OF 1973 AND 1979
STILL IN OUR MINDS, AND WITH HOSTILITIES
BETWEEN IRAQ AND IRAN NOW JEOPARDISING SOME
WESTERN OIL SUPPLIES, IT WAS COMFORTING TO
READ ON SATURDAY THAT AUSTRALIA'S DEMAND FOR
OIL IS LESSENING. ACCORDING TO THE MINISTER FOR
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY, SENATOR
CARRICK, SALES OF MAJOR PETROLEUM PRODUCTS IN
THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF 1980 WERE 4.9
PER CENT DOWN ON THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN
1979. LAST MONTH, SALES WERE 9 PER CENT LOWER
THAN IN AUGUST 1979. AS SENATOR CARRICK
POINTED OUT, SUCH SAVINGS COULD STRETCH
AUSTRALIA'S OIL RESOURCES AS MUCH AS WOULD
DISCOVERY OF A MEDIUM-SIZED OILFIELD IN BASS
STRAIT. BUT WHILE OUR CONSUMPTION OF OIL HAS
FALLEN AS MORE PEOPLE SWITCH TO SMALL CARS AND
GAS AND ELECTRIC HEATING, THE NATION'S RELIANCE
ON OIL IS AS GREAT AS EVER.
ALTHOUGH 70 PER CENT OF AUSTRALIA'S OIL
NEEDS ARE NOW MET FROM INDIGENOUS RESERVES,
IT IS INEVITABLE THAT OUR WELLS WILL RUN DRY.
ESTIMATES ON WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN VARY. THE
STATISTICS RELEASED BY SENATOR CARRICK SUGGEST
IT COULD BE LATER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. BUT
THAT IS NO REASON TO RELAX OUR EFFORTS TO
CONSERVE. A 4.9 PER CENT DROP IN SALES IS
HELPFUL BUT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE
PROBLEM IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS CONTENT
TO REST ON ITS LAURELS. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT
THE DROP IN CONSUMPTION IN THE PAST YEAR IS
ATTRIBUTABLE LARGELY TO THE GOVERNMENT'S WORLD
PARITY PRICING SYSTEM FOR OIL, A SYSTEM THAT,
WHILE UNPOPULAR WITH CONSUMERS, IS BOTH AN
EFFECTIVE METHOD OF ENCOURAGING CONSERVATION
AND A VALID MEANS OF RAISING GOVERNMENT
REVENUE - AN ESTIMATED $3157 MILLION, OR 9.2
PER CENT OF TOTAL REVENUE, THIS FINANCIAL YEAR.
BUT APART FROM USING EVERY PETROL BOWSER IN
THE NATION AS A TAX COLLECTOR, THE GOVERNMENT
IS DOING LITTLE TO ENCOURAGE OIL FRUGALITY AND
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY ALTERNATIVES.
OF COURSE THERE ARE GOVERNMENT-FINANCED
ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS PREACHING THE NEED FOR
CONSERVATION, A SCHEME TO ENCOURAGE MOTORISTS
TO SWITCH FROM PETROL TO LIQUID PETROLEUM GAS,
AND A BUDGET ALLOCATION OF $13.5 MILLION TO
PRIVATE INDUSTRY FOR ENERGY RESEARCH. IT MUST
ALSO BE SAID THAT WORLD PARITY PRICING OF
AUSTRALIAN CRUDE OIL HAS ENCOURAGED THE
PROGRESS OF SOME NEW ENERGY PROJECTS, LIKE THE
RUNDLE SHALE OIL SCHEME IN QUEENSLAND. BUT
WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF SOLAR ENERGY,
THIS COUNTRY LAGS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY
ALTERNATIVES. CONSEQUENTLY, AUSTRALIA IS STILL AS
RELIANT ON OIL AS EVER. ON THE CONSERVATION FRONT,
THERE ARE NO SALES TAX INCENTIVES ON SMALL CARS
AND INADEQUATE AID TO THE STATES TO UPGRADE
PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND IMPROVE ROADS. STATE
GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO LAX. IN VICTORIA, PUBLIC
TRANSPORT IS BEING ALLOWED TO DIE, CAR POOLING
IS HARDLY ENCOURAGED, AND TRAFFIC CONGESTION,
THE GREATEST CAUSE OF OIL WASTAGE, GETS WORSE.
GOVERNMENTS SAY THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR
ENERGY FUTURE. IF THEY ARE, THEY SHOULD DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT - EVEN IF THERE IS NO PROFIT
TO BE MADE.
<F11>
WEDNESDAY 1 OCTOBER 1980
"GAPS IN THE LIBERAL POLICY"
THE LIBERAL PARTY'S ELECTION POLICY SPEECH,
GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR FRASER,
LAST NIGHT, RESOUNDED WITH ROSY PREDICTIONS,
SELF-CONGRATULATION, MISLEADING COMPARISONS AND
TRADITIONAL SCARE-MONGERING. IT WAS FULL OF GOOD
INTENTIONS AND VAGUE GENERALISATIONS. TO THIS
EXTENT, IT WAS A TYPICAL POLICY SPEECH FROM THE
LEADER OF A GOVERNING PARTY. WHAT GAVE IT A
DISTINCTIVE FLAVOR WAS THAT ITS PARTICULAR PROMISES
WERE NUMEROUS RATHER THAN GENEROUS, AIMED AT
STRATEGICALLY PLACED INTEREST GROUPS RATHER THAN
LAVISHED ACROSS BROAD BANDS OF VOTERS, PENSIONERS
AND TAXPAYERS. MINDFUL, NO DOUBT, OF THE
DISCARDED PROMISES AND OVER-CONFIDENT FORECASTS
OF 1975, AND HIS EMPHASIS IN OFFICE ON RESPONSIBLE
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, MR FRASER WAS CAUTIOUS
IN HIS COMMITMENTS. IF HIS FIGURES ARE TO BE
BELIEVED - HIS COSTINGS OF LABOR'S PROPOSED
PROGRAMME SEEM EXAGGERATED - HIS PROMISES
WOULD COST $185 MILLION IN A FULL YEAR, PLUS $40
MILLION IN FORGONE REVENUE.
MR FRASER HAS IDENTIFIED THE FOUR MAIN
CHALLENGES TO NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN THE 1980S
IN TERMS SIMILAR TO THOSE PUT FORWARD BY 'THE
AGE' IN ITS RECENT SERIES OF EDITORIALS ON ELECTION
ISSUES. THE PITY IS THAT HE HAD SO LITTLE TO SAY
ABOUT THEM. UNDERSTANDABLY, HE RANKED
RESPONSIBILITY IN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS FIRST. HERE, AS
BEFORE, PRIORITY WAS GIVEN TO RESTRAINT OF
INFLATION. THE GOVERNMENT, IT IS TRUE, HAS
REDUCED AUSTRALIA'S INFLATION RATE BELOW THE LEVEL
OF 1975 (ALTHOUGH IT IS CREEPING UP AGAIN) AND
BELOW THE AVERAGE IN ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL
COUNTRIES, BUT CONTROL OF INFLATION IS NOT THE
ONLY TEST OF GOOD ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. WHAT
ABOUT THE RATE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH? SINCE 1975
THIS HAS SLUMPED BELOW THE OECD AVERAGE. AFTER
FIVE YEARS, THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY OF HOLDING
BACK PUBLIC SPENDING AND CUTTING CAPITAL WORKS
HAS BARELY STIMULATED THE PROMISED RESURGENCE
OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
AND WHAT ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT? THE WORD
WAS SCARCELY MENTIONED BY MR FRASER IN HIS
SPEECH, EXCEPT IN A REFERENCE TO THE LABOR
PARTY'S SUPPOSED PROFLIGACY. THE REALITY IS THAT
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS RISEN FROM 2.2 PER CENT IN
1974 AND 4.3 PER CENT IN 1975 TO 6.2 PER CENT IN
1979, AND THAT SINCE 1976 IT HAS BEEN ABOVE THE
OECD AVERAGE. THE PRIME MINISTER DWELT INSTEAD
ON AN ALLEGED GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT OF 200,000
IN THE 12 MONTHS TO LAST AUGUST. THIS FIGURE WAS
EVIDENTLY BASED ON A WORKFORCE SURVEY WHICH
DOES NOT DISTINGUISH IN TOTAL BETWEEN FULL-TIME
AND PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT. THE OTHER ACCEPTED
MEASURE OF EMPLOYMENT, THE CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT
SERIES BASED ON PAYROLL TAX RETURNS, SHOWED A
MUCH SMALLER INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT, AND HAS
BEEN OFFICIALLY DISCONTINUED. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST
TIME THE GOVERNMENT HAS CHOSEN AN INSTRUMENT
OF MEASUREMENT THAT GAVE A MORE FAVORABLE
READING AND DISREGARDED ONE THAT DID NOT. AS MR
FRASER IN HIS SPEECH HARDLY RECOGNISED
UNEMPLOYMENT AS A PROBLEM AT ALL, LET ALONE ONE
THAT MOST AUSTRALIANS NOW REGARD AS MORE
PRESSING THAN INFLATION, IT IS PERHAPS NOT
SURPRISING THAT THE ONLY SPECIFIC INITIATIVES TO
ALLEVIATE IT SHOULD BE CONFINED TO A NEW
TRANSITION ALLOWANCE, A HIGHER TRAINING SUBSIDY
AND SPECIAL COUNSELLING SERVICES FOR JOBLESS YOUTH
(TOTAL COST $25 MILLION) - AND AN EXPANSION OF
THE AUSTRALIAN VOLUNTEER ABROAD SCHEME.
THE SECOND IMPORTANT CHALLENGE NAMED BY
THE PRIME MINISTER WAS TO HARNESS AUSTRALIA'S
RESOURCES IN A CO-ORDINATED AND RESPONSIBLE
PROGRAMME OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. QUITE SO,
BUT HOW? IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO CROW ABOUT THIS
COUNTRY'S RICH NATURAL RESOURCES AND TO BASK
IN THE EAGERNESS OF OVERSEAS INVESTORS TO EXPLOIT
THEM. THEIR VALUE DEPENDS LESS ON GOVERNMENT
POLICIES THAN ON WORLD DEMAND. THE REAL TEST
OF GOVERNMENT COMPETENCE LIES IN THE
MANAGEMENT OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT TO ENSURE
THAT THE BENEFIT FLOWS TO THE AUSTRALIAN
COMMUNITY, THAT IT IS EQUITABLY SHARED, AND THAT
THE ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS ARE RESPONSIBLY
ABSORBED. MR FRASER GAVE LITTLE INDICATION OF
HOW HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD COPE WITH THESE
PROBLEMS AND SPOKE WITH THE UTMOST CAUTION
ON THE NECESSITY TO RESTRUCTURE UNECONOMIC
INDUSTRIES. THE PRIME MINISTER MADE A SPIRITED
DEFENCE OF THE OIL PARITY PRICING POLICY, WHICH
IS ECONOMICALLY PREFERABLE TO LABOR'S POLICY, BUT
HE HAD LITTLE USEFUL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE VEXED
PROBLEM OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, IN WHICH HIS
GOVERNMENT'S RECORD IS HARDLY GLORIOUS.
PERHAPS THE LEAST CONVINCING PART OF THE
POLICY SPEECH CAME UNDER THE HEADING OF POLICIES
FOR PEOPLE, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON PROVIDING
ADEQUATELY FOR THOSE IN NEED. CERTAINLY, THE
PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCED MODEST MEASURES TO
HELP THE HOMELESS, THE HANDICAPPED, THE
DISTRESSED AND THE DISADVANTAGED. THESE ARE TO
BE WELCOMED. BUT THERE WAS NO ADMISSION THAT
MORE THAN TWO MILLION AUSTRALIANS LIVE BELOW
AN AUSTERELY DRAWN POVERTY LINE AND NO
MENTION OF HOW AUSTRALIA SHOULD DEAL WITH
DIRE DEPRIVATION IN A LAND BLESSED WITH
ABUNDANCE. INSTEAD, A HIGHLIGHT OF THE POLICY
SPEECH WAS THE PROMISE OF INCREASED HOME
SAVINGS GRANTS, A BENEFIT THAT IN PRACTICE WOULD
FLOW MAINLY TO TWO-INCOME FAMILIES (WHO ELSE
COULD SAVE ENOUGH?) AND THAT IS LIKELY TO BE
OFFSET BY RISING INTEREST RATES (ANOTHER PROSPECT
ON WHICH THE PRIME MINISTER REMAINED SILENT).
AND, IN THE TRADITION OF THE ROMAN EMPERORS,
THE GOVERNMENT OFFERS THE POOR THE DISTRACTION
OF CIRCUSES OR, MORE PRECISELY, FUNDS FOR SPORTS
FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE PROSPECT OF AN EQUESTRIAN
CENTRE FOR VICTORIA.
THE FINAL CHALLENGE - NATIONAL SECURITY -
WAS MET IN THE POLICY SPEECH MAINLY BY
PATRIOTIC RHETORIC AND PROMISES OF INCREASED
DEFENCE SPENDING UNACCOMPANIED BY ANY
REASONED EXPLANATION OF HOW THIS CORRESPONDS
WITH STRATEGIC REQUIREMENTS. ALTHOUGH MR FRASER
SPOKE OF A THRUST TOWARDS GREATER SELF-RELIANCE
IN DEFENCE, SOME OF THE MAIN PROCUREMENT PLANS
SUGGEST RATHER A RETURN TO THE 1960S CONCEPT OF
FORWARD DEFENCE IN HARNESS WITH POWERFUL
FRIENDS AND ALLIES,
MR FRASER DID NOT SPEND MUCH TIME
DISCUSSING THE LABOR ALTERNATIVE, EXCEPT TO
DENIGRATE IT WITH SUSPECT COSTINGS AND DIRE
WARNINGS OF "WHITLAM YEARS RECYCLED". HIS
ATTEMPT TO PAINT LABOR AS THE PARTY OF HIGH
TAXATION BY QUOTING TAX SCALES THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN SUPERSEDED EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN NO
CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT IN 1975 IS MISLEADING TO
THE POINT OF ABSURDITY. WHAT IS PERTINENT IS THAT
THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAS STILL NOT RESTORED
FULL INDEXATION, SO THAT IT IS STILL INCREASING THE
TAX BURDEN BY STEALTH THROUGH INFLATION. (IN FACT,
PERSONAL TAX REVENUE HAS NEARLY DOUBLED IN THE
PAST FIVE YEARS. EVEN MORE PERTINENT IS THE
FINDING BY THE PARLIAMENTARY RESEARCH STAFF THAT,
AFTER ADJUSTING INCOMES FOR INFLATION, TAX
CHANGES, THE FAMILY ALLOWANCE AND HEALTH
INSURANCE, THE AVERAGE WAGE EARNER WITH A
DEPENDENT WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN WOULD HAVE TO
EARN AN EXTRA $16 A WEEK TO MAINTAIN HIS 1975
PURCHASING POWER. FOR THE AVERAGE WAGE EARNER,
NAT TO MENTION THE UNEMPLOYED, LIVING STANDARDS
HAVE DECLINED. WHETHER THIS WAS NECESSARY OR
UNAVOIDABLE IN THE INTERESTS OF THE ECONOMY IS
ANOTHER QUESTION, BUT IT IS DECEPTIVE TO PRETEND
THAT LOWER TAXATION RATES HAVE LEFT ORDINARY
PEOPLE BETTER OFF.
THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS GOVERNMENT
DESERVE CREDIT FOR CONSISTENCY AND STRENGTH OF
PURPOSE. THEY HAVE NOT DEVIATED FROM THEIR
ECONOMIC POLICY OF RESTRAINING INFLATION AND
REDUCING DEFICIT BUDGETING. BUT THE SOCIAL COSTS,
IN TERMS OF LOWERED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND
INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT, HAVE BEEN HEAVY, AND
THE SUPPOSED BENEFITS SLOW TO EMERGE. MR FRASER
HAS ACCURATELY POINTED TO THE GREAT CHALLENGES
FACING THIS NATION, BUT HE HAS BEEN VAGUE AND
EVASIVE IN EXPLAINING HOW THEY ARE TO BE MET. HE
CAN NO LONGER RELY ON BAD MEMORIES OF THE
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT; HE MUST STAND ON HIS OWN
RECORD. TO HIS CREDIT, HE NOW IS LESS EXPANSIVE
IN HIS PREDICTIONS THAN HE WAS FIVE YEARS AGO,
AND HE HAS NOT SUCCUMBED TO THE TEMPTATION OF
EXPENSIVE VOTE-BUYING (WITH SOME PORK-
BARRELLING EXCEPTIONS). BUT THE INTELLIGENT VOTER,
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS NATION AND
THE QUALITY OF ITS SOCIETY, WILL WANT TO KNOW
MUCH MORE THAN MR FRASER HAS BEEN WILLING OR
ABLE TO SAY IN THIS POLICY SPEECH AND ITS ATTACHED
STATEMENTS.
<F12>
THURSDAY 2 OCTOBER 1980
"LABOR'S ROBIN HOOD POLICY"
UNLIKE A PRIME MINISTER, THE LEADER OF THE
OPPOSITION CANNOT RECITE A RECORD OF
ACHIEVEMENT IN HIS ELECTION POLICY SPEECH AND
TOOK CREDIT FOR CONSISTENCY OF PURPOSE. HE MUST
PRESENT A FRESH ALTERNATIVE AND HOPE THAT IT WILL
BE ACCEPTED ON TRUST. MR HAYDEN DID THIS LAST
NIGHT, AND VERY CLEVERLY TOO. IN A TONE OF
CHARACTERISTIC MODESTY, YET NOT WITHOUT
ELOQUENCE, HE OUTLINED A PROGRAMME THAT WAS
SHREWDLY CONSTRUCTED, ATTRACTIVELY PACKAGED AND
PLAUSIBLY COSTED. UNDER THE SLOGAN OF A "FAIR GO
FOR AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES", IT WAS PITCHED AT THE
BROAD MASS OF VOTERS, APPEALING TO A MIXTURE
OF, SELF-INTEREST AND CONCERN FOR THE
LESS FORTUNATE, AND STRIVING TO BALANCE THE
DEMANDS OF ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY, SOCIAL
JUSTICE AND POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY. BUT FOR ALL
ITS VIRTUES, IT IS OPEN TO SERIOUS CRITICISM AND
SCEPTICISM.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT IN ADVANCE
TO DISCREDIT THE LABOR POLICY BY DISMISSING IT
AS EXTRAVAGANT AND IRRESPONSIBLE. IT WOULD BE
MORE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT IT HAS A ROBIN HOOD
QUALITY. THE RICH AND THE PRIVILEGED - COMPANY
TAX BENEFICIARIES, PROFITABLE RESOURCE DEVELOPERS
AND INCOME TAX AVOIDERS - WOULD BE MADE TO
PAY TO "REVERSE THE DECLINE IN FAMILY LIVING
STANDARDS" AND TO HELP THOSE MOST IN NEED.
THE NET COST TO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET OF HIS SIX-
POINT FAMILY PROGRAMME WOULD BE, ACCORDING
TO MR HAYDEN, $550 MILLION. THIS IS CERTAINLY
MORE THAN THE $225 MILLION THE PRIME MINISTER
PROMISED TO SPEND AND FORGO IN TAX CONCESSIONS
IN A FULL YEAR, BUT IN AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF MORE
THAN $30,000 MILLION AND ECONOMY OF SOME
$120,000 MILLION, IT CAN HARDLY BE CALLED RIP-
ROARING EXTRAVAGANCE (IF MR HAYDEN'S FIGURES
ARE RELIABLE).
THE HAYDEN PROGRAMME CONTAINED FEW
SURPRISES BECAUSE MOST OF THE POLICIES  AND
INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED PROGRESSIVELY
OVER THE PAST YEAR. (ONE NEW COMMITMENT,
AND A SLY DIG AT MR FRASER, WAS TO SELL TWO
VIP BOEING 707 JETS THE GOVERNMENT ACQUIRED
AT A COST OF $20 MILLION FOR PRIME MINISTERIAL
TRIPS ABROAD.) THE LABOR LEADER'S KEY PROMISE
WAS AN ACROSS-THE-BOARD $3 A WEEK CUT IN INCOME
TAX FROM 1 FEBRUARY NEXT. THE PARTY CHOSE THIS
FROM AMONG THE THREE OPTIONS ALREADY MADE
PUBLIC, THE DISCARDED ONES BEING A GENERAL
REDUCTION IN SALES TAX ALSO OF $300 MILLION OR A
THREE CENTS A LITRE CUT IN THE PRICE OF PETROL
AND OIL. THE GOVERNMENT WILL FIND IT HARD TO
CRITICISE THE INCOME TAX CUT WITH CREDIBILITY,
HAVING USED A SIMILAR PLOY TO WIN THE 1977
ELECTION (AND HAVING CLAWED BACK THE BENEFIT
LATER). WHAT MAY BE SAID FOR THE LABOR PROPOSAL
IS THAT IT WOULD BE OF GREATEST HELP TO LOW-INCOME
EARNERS AND FREE MANY FROM THE OBLIGATION TO
PAY INCOME TAX AT ALL.
WHILE THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO GIVE
PRIORITY TO CONTAINING INFLATION, THE LABOR POLICY
FOCUSES INSTEAD ON UNEMPLOYMENT. A HAYDEN
ADMINISTRATION WOULD UNDERTAKE TO CREATE
100,000 NEW JOBS IN ITS FIRST FULL YEAR OF OFFICE.
HALF WOULD BE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN A COMMUNITY
SERVICE CORPS PROGRAMME, ANOTHER 20,000 WOULD
BE FOR UNEMPLOYED ADULTS WITH DEPENDANTS,
AND THE REMAINING 20,000 WOULD BE CREATED BY
SUBSIDISING WAGES BY UP TO 50 PER CENT. SUCH
SCHEMES, OF COURSE, ARE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE
RESTORATION OF PERMANENT, SELF-SUSTAINING JOBS.
BUT IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT THEY ARE PREFERABLE
TO IDLENESS AND WELFARE HANDOUTS. WHETHER
ARTIFICIALLY CREATED JOBS CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO
PERMANENT JOBS DEPENDS BASICALLY ON THE RATE
OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHICH IN THE PAST THREE
YEARS HAS FALLEN BELOW THE AVERAGE IN THE
ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES.
HERE THE LABOR PARTY IS TAKING A CALCULATED
GAMBLE. MR HAYDEN ARGUED THAT HIS POLICY OF
PUTTING EXTRA PURCHASING POWER INTO THE HANDS
OF AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO
ARE POORER AND WHO WOULD SPEND ANY ADDITIONAL
INCOME, WOULD STIMULATE DEMAND AND THEREFORE
GENERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RISK OF SUCH AN
EXPANSIONARY POLICY IS THAT IT COULD BE DISSIPATED
IN HIGHER INFLATION. THE ESSENTIAL OFFSET IN THE
LABOR STRATEGY IS THE SUGGESTION OF A PRICES AND
INCOMES POLICY. THIS IS PERHAPS THE CHANCIEST
ASPECT OF THE WHOLE PACKAGE, AND MR HAYDEN
WAS CAREFUL TO SAY HE COULD NOT GUARANTEE
SUCCESS. BUT THE LABOR PARTY HAS REACHED
AGREEMENT WITH THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT TO
"ESTABLISH THE FRAMEWORK FOR CONSULTATION AND
NEGOTIATION" BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL
WINGS OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT ON PRICES AND
INCOMES, AND ITS HOPE IS THAT MR BOB HAWKE
AS INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS MINISTER WOULD HELP TO
MAKE IT EFFECTIVE. IN THE LIGHT OF EXPERIENCE
ABROAD AND THE LIKELY RESISTANCE OF MILITANT
UNIONS TO ANY SERIOUS CONSTRAINT ON WAGE RISES,
IT SEEMS A LONG SHOT. BUT AT LEAST, IN CONTRAST
TO THE WHITLAM YEARS, THE LABOR PARTY NOW
RECOGNISES THE LINK BETWEEN INFLATION AND WAGES.
LESS NEED BE SAID ON THE OTHER PROPOSALS
TO ARREST THE DECLINE IN REAL LIVING STANDARDS OF
MOST WAGE-EARNERS AND WELFARE DEPENDANTS.
THE COMMITMENT TO FREEZE THE PRICE OF ALL
LOCALLY PRODUCED CRUDE OIL FOR 12 MONTHS IS
IRRESPONSIBLE, BUT IT MUST BE NOTED THAT THE
GOVERNMENT HAS UNDERTAKEN TO FREEZE IT FOR SIX
MONTHS. LABOR'S FAMILY HOME OWNERSHIP PLAN
IS LESS REGRESSIVE AND MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE
GOVERNMENT'S PROMISE TO INCREASE HOME
SAVINGS GRANTS. THE PROMISE OF INCOME
SUPPLEMENT PAYMENTS TO POOR FAMILIES WOULD
GO SOME WAY TOWARDS BRINGING THOSE MOST IN
NEED UP TO THE POVERTY LINE. LABOR IS
COMMITTED TO THE GRADUAL RESTORATION OF
MEDIBANK AND WOULD, AS A START, EXTEND FREE
MEDICAL CARE TO PREGNANT WOMEN AND
DEPENDENT CHILDREN. THE GOVERNMENT, BY
CONTRAST, HAS NOT EXPLAINED HOW IT WOULD
RESOLVE THE HEALTH INSURANCE MUDDLE AND IT
MAY BE ASSUMED THAT HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD
BECOME INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE FOR THE AVERAGE
FAMILY.
TO COVER THE COST OF MOST OF THE LABOR
PROGRAMME, A HAYDEN GOVERNMENT WOULD
INTRODUCE THREE NEW REVENUE-RAISING MEASURES,
INTENDED TO YIELD $1000 MILLION IN A FULL YEAR.
TWO ARE, ON BALANCE, JUSTIFIABLE. ONE IS
QUESTIONABLE IN PRINCIPLE AND LIKELY PRACTICE.
LABOR WOULD ABOLISH THE INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE
WHICH, MR HAYDEN ARGUED WITH SOME
JUSTIFICATION, HAS BEEN USED BY MANY FIRMS TO
REPLACE MEN WITH MACHINES. INVESTMENT IN
UP-TO-DATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS HIGHLY
DESIRABLE IF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY IS TO REMAIN
COMPETITIVE, BUT IT MUST BE ASKED WHETHER A
NATION SAID TO BE ON THE BRINK OF A $29,000
MILLION RESOURCES BOOM REALLY NEEDS TO OFFER
TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT. A LABOR
GOVERNMENT WOULD LEVY A RESOURCE RENT TAX ON
HIGHLY PROFITABLE RESOURCE-BASED PROJECTS. THIS
IS SOMETHING MOST OTHER COMPARABLE
RESOURCE-RICH COUNTRIES IMPOSE AND WHICH THE
GOVERNMENT ITSELF PROPOSED UNTIL DETERRED BY
PROTESTS BY BIG BUSINESS. INTELLIGENTLY APPLIED,
SUCH A TAX SHOULD NOT INHIBIT EXPLORATION AND
DEVELOPMENT, BUT IT WOULD ENSURE THAT MORE OF
THE BENEFIT FLOWS TO AUSTRALIA AND LESS
ABROAD. THE THIRD PROPOSAL - TO ABOLISH TAX
AVOIDANCE - IS LAUDABLE IN INTENTION BUT
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. LABOR WOULD TRY
TO DO SO WITH RETROSPECTIVE LEGISLATION, A
METHOD WE CANNOT CONDONE.
YESTERDAY WE POINTED TO GAPS IN THE
LIBERAL POLICY. LABOR'S GAPS ARE NO LESS GLARING.
THERE WAS NOT A WORD ABOUT HOW A HAYDEN
GOVERNMENT WOULD MANAGE THE RESOURCES BOOM
(OTHER THAN TO TAX IT) AND ITS IMPACT ON EXISTING
INDUSTRY, THE EXCHANGE RATE AND THE ECONOMY.
THERE WAS NOT A WORD ABOUT THE NECESSITY TO
RESTRUCTURE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY AND LOWER
THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION. DEFENCE SEEMED AN
AFTERTHOUGHT. LABOR WOULD ACCEPT THE SPENDING
OBJECTIVES ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT BUT
WOULD, IN DUE COURSE, REVIEW SPENDING
PRIORITIES. THE SUGGESTION OF MORE MONEY FOR
DEFENCE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT IS ONE ASPECT THAT
REQUIRES SECOND THOUGHTS; THE MORE PRESSING
NEED IS TO BUILD UP COMMAND STRUCTURES AND
LOGISTICS TO EQUIP THE ARMED FORCES FOR
CONTINENTAL DEFENCE RATHER THAN EXPEDITIONARY
MISSIONS WITH COSTLY SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT.
BUT THE WEAKEST PART OF MR HAYDEN'S
POLICY STATEMENT IS PRECISELY IN AN AREA WHERE
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STRONG. IT IS NOT DIFFICULT,
IN OPPOSITION, TO PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAMME OF
SOCIAL REFORM THAT SOUNDS PLAUSIBLE AND
COMPASSIONATE. THE WELL-OFF WILL BE CONFIRMED
IN THEIR OPINION THAT THE PARTY PUTTING FORWARD
SUCH COSTLY PROPOSALS IS FINANCIALLY IRRESPONSIBLE;
BUT BY DEFINITION THE LESS WELL-OFF VOTERS
OUTNUMBER THE WELL-OFF.
WHAT MR HAYDEN IN HIS POLICY SPEECH
SHOWED SCARCELY A SIGN OF RECOGNISING WAS THAT
HIS PROGRAMME OF SOCIAL REFORM, AND ITS PLACE
IN THE KIND OF AUSTRALIA THAT HIS PARTY WOULD
LIKE TO SEE, IS CONNECTED WITH EVENTS IN THE
OUTSIDE WORLD. THE POLICY SPEECH DEVOTED
PRECISELY FOUR SENTENCES TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS
(ALTHOUGH WE ARE GLAD THAT ONE OF THEM PROMISES
TO WITHDRAW RECOGNITION OF THE MURDEROUS
POL POT). FROM THE HAYDEN SPEECH, NO ONE
WOULD KNOW THAT A HIGHLY DANGEROUS WAR IS IN
PROGRESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. NO ONE WOULD
KNOW THAT MR HAYDEN'S PETROL PRICING POLICY,
BY WHICH HE SETS SUCH STORE, HAS ANY
CONNECTION WITH DECISIONS ALREADY TAKEN, OR TO
BE TAKEN IN THE FUTURE, BY OPEC. NO ONE WOULD
KNOW THAT THE SOVIET UNION HAD LATELY
EXPANDED ITS INFLUENCE - TO PUT THE MATTER AT
ITS MILDEST - NOT SO VERY FAR FROM CAPE YORK.
MR FRASER'S FOREIGN AND DEFENCE POLICIES MAY
BE UNCONVINCING, BUT HE DID AT LEAST ADDRESS
HIMSELF TO THEM IN HIS PLATFORM SPEECH. MR
HAYDEN VIRTUALLY IGNORED THEM ALTOGETHER. THE
INTELLIGENT VOTER DESERVES SOMETHING BETTER
THAN THIS DEAFENING SILENCE.
<F13>
FRIDAY 3 OCTOBER 1980
"THERE'S STILL A SANTA CLAUS"
AS LEADER OF THE NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY, MR
ANTHONY FACES A DIFFICULTY IN PRESENTING HIS
ELECTION POLICY SPEECH. IT IS, OF COURSE, THE PRIME
MINISTER'S PREROGATIVE TO DECLARE THE BROAD
POLICIES AND MAKE THE IMPORTANT PROMISES OF A
COALITION GOVERNMENT. YET THE LEADER OF THE
MINORITY PARTY NEEDS TO SAY SOMETHING DISTINCTIVE
TO DISTINGUISH IT AS A SEPARATE ENTITY WITHOUT
STRAINING A HARMONIOUS COALITION RELATIONSHIP. AS
USUAL, MR ANTHONY SOLVED THE PROBLEM THIS WEEK
BOTH IN STYLE AND CONTENT. HE SPOKE IN WORDS OF
FEW SYLLABLES AND SENTENCES OF FEW WORDS SO THAT
EVEN THE SIMPLEST RURAL VOTER COULD UNDERSTAND
HIS MESSAGE. THIS WAS TO "KEEP AUSTRALIA STRONG"
IN AN EVIOUS WORLD.IT MADE A CHANGE FROM
SEEING A SOCIALIST UNDER EVERY HAYSTACK.
THE BULK OF HIS SPEECH SUGGESTED THAT
"NATIONAL" IS LARGELY A COSMETIC ADDITION TO
"COUNTRY" IN HIS PARTY'S NAME. THE TRADITIONAL
ROLE OF THE COUNTRY PARTY HAS BEEN TO DELIVER
- OR AT LEAST PROMISE - A CORNUCOPIA OF
CONCESSIONS, INCENTIVES AND PROJECTS TO THE RURAL
ELECTORATE. MR ANTHONY IS, IN THIS SENSE, A
TRADITIONALIST. THERE WERE TO BE A NEW RANGE OF
TAX CONCESSIONS - FOR FUEL STORAGE FACILITIES,
CONNECTIONS TO A MAINS ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AND
SOIL CONSERVATION WORKS - AND A DEPRECIATION
ALLOWANCE FOR NEW AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY. IT
MAY BE ASKED WHY FARMERS, WHOSE CURRENT
ANNUAL INCOME AVERAGES $29,000, SHOULD BE
SINGLED OUT FOR EVEN MORE TAX CONCESSIONS, AND
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE GREATEST BENEFITS
WOULD GO TO THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST INCOMES.
IN ALL, THERE WERE SOME 20 SPECIFIC PROMISES,
INCLUDING $3 MILLION FOR A NATIONAL SOIL
CONSERVATION PROGRAMME, SOMETHING PROMISED IN
A PREVIOUS CAMPAIGN BUT NOT YET DELIVERED. IN
MR ANTHONY'S BOOK, ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY
APPARENTLY MEANS LITTLE MORE THAN KEEPING DOWN
INFLATION AND KEEPING UP RURAL INCOMES.
MR ANTHONY IS MINISTER FOR TRADE AND
RESOURCES BUT HAD LITTLE TO SAY ON EITHER OF
THOSE SUBJECTS (OR ON ANY OTHER SUBJECT EXCEPT
THE NEED FOR STRONG LEADERSHIP AND MORE HELP
FOR RURAL AUSTRALIA). HE GAVE NO RECOGNITION THAT
THERE MIGHT BE PROBLEMS OF MANAGING THE COMING
RESOURCES BOOM, OR QUESTIONS CONCERNING
AUSTRALIAN OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL, OR CONFLICTS
WITH STATE GOVERNMENTS AND ABORIGINAL
COMMUNITIES. HE DID, TO HIS CREDIT, VIGOROUSLY
DEFEND THE GOVERNMENT'S OIL IMPORT PARITY
PRICING POLICY, WHICH HAS AROUSED WIDESPREAD
RESENTMENT IN THE COUNTRY. HE ALSO ARGUED
STRONGLY THAT THE PROPOSED RAILWAY FROM ALICE
SPRINGS TO DARWIN, WHICH SOME ECONOMISTS SEE
AS A MISUSE OF SCARCE FUNDS, IS ESSENTIAL FOR
DEVELOPMENT AND DEFENCE.
TO ANYONE WHO WOULD NOT BE A BENEFICIARY
OF HIS LARGESSE, MR ANTHONY'S POLICY SPEECH IS
LIKELY TO CONFIRM THE IMPRESSION THAT THE SIMPLE
MOTTO OF THE NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY IS "WHAT'S
GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY IS GOOD FOR THE NATION".
"TWO DULL AND DECENT MEN"
IN LESS THAN FIVE WEEKS AMERICAN VOTERS WILL
CHOOSE THEIR 40TH PRESIDENT. BUT AN ELECTION
WHICH SHOULD BE CHARTING THE NATION'S COURSE
FOR THE 1980S HAS BECOME AN EXERCISE IN ENNUI.
IN MARYLAND, A RECENT POLL REVEALED THAT MORE
THAN HALF THE VOTERS HAD NOT YET MADE UP THEIR
MINDS FOR WHOM THEY WOULD VOTE ON 4 NOVEMBER
AND MOST REGISTERED DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
WERE NOT YET READY TO ACCEPT THE NOMINEE OF
THEIR OWN PARTY. ACROSS THE NATION, THE REACTION
IS MUCH THE SAME. ON THE HUSTINGS, THE
CANDIDATES AND THEIR HANDLERS COMPLAIN THAT THE
CROWDS ARE SMALL AND APATHETIC. INCREASINGLY,
BOTH JIMMY CARTER AND RONALD REAGAN ARE
TURNING TO TELEVISION TO GET THEIR MESSAGE ACROSS
TO AN ELECTORATE THAT PERSISTS IN ITS JUDGMENT
THAT NEITHER CANDIDATE IS WORTH THE TIME OF DAY.
VOTER PARTICIPATION IN AMERICA HAS BEEN
DROPPING STEADILY SINCE 1960. THE DISMAL PROSPECT
IS THAT ONLY A MINORITY OF ADULT AMERICANS MAY
BOTHER TO TURN OUT TO ELECT THEIR NEXT PRESIDENT
AND THAT THE EVENTUAL WINNER WILL HAVE THE ACTIVE
APPROVAL OF NO MORE THAN A QUARTER OF THOSE
ENTITLED TO VOTE.
CONDITIONED BY TELEVISION TO LOOK ON EACH
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AS A KIND OF POLITICAL "HIGH
NOON", AMERICANS HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED BY THE
RELUCTANCE OF MR CARTER AND MR REAGAN TO FACE
EACH OTHER DOWN. BOTH HAVE SUCCESSFULLY AVOIDED
A HEAD-ON CONFRONTATION, WHILE MOVING CAUTIOUSLY
TO OCCUPY THE MIDDLE GROUND. THERE HAS BEEN
NO GREAT DEBATE IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION CAMERAS
AND PRECIOUS LITTLE EXCHANGE ON THE ISSUES. MR
CARTER BRIEFLY ENLIVENED THINGS LAST MONTH BY
HINTING THAT MR REAGAN WAS A CLOSET RACIST AND
A WARMONGER, CHARGES WHICH HIS OPPONENT LOFTILY
DISMISSED AS "BENEATH DECENCY". ALTHOUGH IT WAS
TAME ENOUGH STUFF BY ANTIPODEAN STANDARDS, IT
PROVOKED MUCH TUT-TUTTING FROM THE EDITORIAL
WRITERS. FOR THEIR PART, THE VOTERS SEEMED TO
ENJOY IT. THEY WERE ON THE POINT OF GOING TO
SLEEP.
THE CAMPAIGN IS NOW GRINDING DOWN INTO
A PLAY-SAFE CONTEST BETWEEN TWO DECENT BUT DULL
MEN WHO HAVE NOTHING MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THE
CHALLENGES AMERICA AND ITS ALLIES WILL FACE IN
THE NEXT DECADE. THE PRESIDENT IS FIGHTING
A LIMITED "ROSE GARDEN" STRATEGY, MAKING
OCCASIONAL FORAYS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO
ADDRESS CAREFULLY SCREENED TOWN MEETINGS OR
TO DELIVER SET-PIECE SPEECHES TO AUDIENCES CHOSEN
FOR THEIR CONGENIALITY OR THE SENSITIVITY OF THEIR
SPECIAL INTERESTS. MR REAGAN HAS ASSUMED A
PRESIDENTIAL POSE. HE NOW TRAVELS SURROUNDED
BY AN ENTOURAGE WHOSE PRIME FUNCTION IS TO
MANOEUVRE THE TELEVISION CAMERAS INTO RANGE
WHILE KEEPING AN OVER-CURIOUS WRITING PRESS AT
A SAFE DISTANCE.
IF HIS MAIN AIM HAS BEEN TO SHED HIS
REPUTATION AS AN OUTSPOKEN IDEOLOGUE, MR
REAGAN SEEMS TO HAVE SUCCEEDED. BUT IN HIS
EFFORT TO AVOID THE GAFFES WHICH EARLIER COST HIM
CREDIBILITY, HE HAS EMERGED AS A BLAND BUT
AMIABLE IMITATION OF THE JIMMY CARTER WHO WON
IN 1976 BY PROMISING TO LOWER TAXES, CUT
GOVERNMENT SPENDING, AND PURGE THE FEDERAL
BUREAUCRACY.
IN A CONTEST BETWEEN MR CARTER'S COMPETENCE
AND MR REAGAN'S CHARACTER, BOTH ARE IN DANGER
OF LOSING. THE POLLSTERS PREDICT A CLOSE RACE, WITH
LITTLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO BECAUSE MOST
VOTERS HAVE CONCLUDED MOROSELY THAT THERE IS,
INDEED, LITTLE FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE. THE RESULT
MAY DEPEND ON HOW MANY VOTES THE THIRD
CANDIDATE, JOHN ANDERSON, CAN SYPHON OFF. MR
ANDERSON'S OWN PROSPECTS, NEVER MORE THAN A
WALTER MITTY FANTASY, HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY
FORLORN. BUT CONFRONTED WITH THE ACCUSATION THAT
HE IS NOTHING BUT A SPOILER, MR ANDERSON ANGRILY
DEMANDS, "WHAT'S TO SPOIL?" AND ON THAT POINT,
AT LEAST, HE APPEARS TO HAVE THE AGREEMENT OF THE
MAJORITY OF AMERICA'S APATHETIC VOTERS.
<F14>
SATURDAY 4 OCTOBER 1980
"FINAL BELL FOR MUHAMMAD ALI"
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY ERA IN THE HISTORY OF
WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING ENDED SADLY IN
A CARPARK IN LAS VEGAS YESTERDAY. WHEN
MUHAMMAD ALI FAILED TO ANSWER THE BELL FOR THE
START OF THE 11TH ROUND, THE WORLD AND LARRY
HOLMES SHED A TEAR. NOT EVEN ALI, THE MOST
LOVED, HATED AND RESPECTED BOXER OF HIS TIME,
HIS PLACE IN WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT HISTORY FIRMLY
SECURE, HAD BEEN ABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION
TO TRY TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP AN
UNPRECEDENTED FOURTH TIME.
WHEN HE ENTERED THE RING SIX MINUTES
BEFORE THE CHAMPION, THERE WAS A FEELING THAT
HE MIGHT JUST DO IT. HIS HANDSOME, BOYISH FACE
- UNMARKED BY A REMARKABLE 20-YEAR CAREER
THAT HAD ITS BEGINNING AS CASSIUS CLAY WITH A
GOLD MEDAL AT THE 1960 ROME OLYMPICS - BORE
NO SIGNS OF THE TOIL HE HAD GONE THROUGH TO LOSE
15 KILOGRAMS IN PREPARATION FOR A BOUT THAT MANY
SAID WAS FOLLY. THERE WAS EVEN A TOUCH OF THE
OLD ALI COCKINESS AS HE SHED HIS WHITE DRESSING
GOWN REVEALING A REJUVENATED, IF SOMEWHAT
ROUNDED, BODY. THE LIKELY OUTCOME OF THE
CONTEST TOOK ON A NEW PERSPECTIVE, HOWEVER,
WITH THE ARRIVAL IN THE RING OF THE CHAMPION.
AT 30, LARRY HOLMES IS AN AWESOME SIGHT, AT
THE PEAK OF HIS CONSIDERABLE POWERS, AND IT
SOON BECAME APPARENT HE WAS TOO FORMIDABLE
FOR ALI. HIS PUNCHES CAME SO QUICKLY, SO
BRUTALLY, IT WAS LIKE WATCHING BRADMAN BAT. IT
TOOK HIM ONLY A ROUND OR TWO AND ALI HAD LOST
HIS BUTTERFLY AND HIS BEE. A SLOW-MOTION FLOAT,
AN OCCASIONAL INSIPID STING AND A LOT OF SPIRIT
WERE ALL THAT REMAINED.
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU WANTED TO SEE
THIS GREAT ATHLETE, THIS LOUD-MOUTH FROM
LOUISVILLE, HUMILIATED, PUT IN HIS PLACE. NOT THIS
WAY THOUGH, AT 38, COMING FACE-TO-FACE  WITH
THE CRUELEST BOXING LINE OF THEM ALL: "HE FAILED
TO ANSWER THE BELL". HOLMES HAD A JOB TO DO
AND HE DID IT LIKE A PROFESSIONAL. WHEN IT WAS
ALL OVER - MERCIFULLY WITHOUT ALI FLAT ON HIS
BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RING - AN EMOTIONAL
HOLMES, HIS TIMING SPOT-ON TO THE END, SAID IT
FOR EVERYONE: "I HAVE NEVER FELT LIKE THIS BEFORE.
I LOVE THE GUY. HE GOES DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE
GREATEST FIGHTER OF ALL TIME. YOU CAN'T KNOCK
A MAN FOR TRYING. WE ALL COME AND WE ALL GO".
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
AMONG THE BENEFITS SUPPOSED TO BE CONFERRED
BY A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS THE OPPORTUNITY
AT ELECTION TIME TO TRANSLATE PUBLIC OPINION INTO
POPULAR GOVERNMENT. IT IS HOPED THAT THIS RESULT
WILL BE ACHIEVED BY UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE,
COMPULSORY VOTING AND SOMETHING LIKE THE IDEAL
OF THE EQUAL VALUE OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE ONE MAN,
ONE VOTE CONCEPT.
THIS MIGHT SEEM TO IMPLY THAT IF EVERYONE
VOTED FOR THE CANDIDATE OR PARTY WHICH WAS LIKELY
TO BENEFIT HIM THE MAJORITY WOULD BE SATISFIED AND
TRUE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED.
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
EVEN IF THERE WERE ANY WAY BY WHICH THE
INDIVIDUAL VOTER COULD BE SURE THAT THE PROMISES
MADE BY CANDIDATES WOULD BE HONORED OR, IF
HONORED, WOULD ACHIEVE THE PROMISED RESULTS,
THERE WOULD STILL BE LEFT MUCH TO BE DESIRED.
IF EACH OF US VOTED FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKELY
TO BE GOOD FOR HIMSELF, THE RESULT WOULD BE THAT
THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPARATIVELY PROSPEROUS
MAJORITY WOULD BE PREFERRED OVER THE NEEDS OF
THE COMPARATIVELY UNDERPRIVILEGED MINORITY. THUS
WOULD BE PERPETUATED THE INEQUALITIES AND
INJUSTICES OF A SELFISH SOCIETY.
DEMOCRACY MEANS MORE THAN THAT. IT MEANS
THE ACCEPTANCE BY ALL THE PEOPLE OF A SHARE IN
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT. DEMOCRACY IS
NOT ONLY GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE
PEOPLE BUT IS ALSO FOR THE PEOPLE.
THIS INCLUDES, AND INDEED SHOULD PREFER, THE
INTERESTS OF THOSE UNABLE TO FIGHT FOR THEMSELVES
AND THOSE WHO, FOR VARIOUS REASONS, SUFFER FROM
THE RESULTS OF INFLATION BUT WHO, BECAUSE THEY
ARE NOT EARNING, CANNOT PROFIT FROM IT.
AGAIN, THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE EQUATION, THE
DECISION TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THOSE WHO PROMISE
MOST TO THE UNDERPRIVILEGED. OTHER FACTORS ARE
INVOLVED: THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM, THE CONTROL OF
WEALTH, THE PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION, INFLATION ITSELF.
THE COMMON DENOMINATOR IS THE CONCEPT OF WHAT
KIND OF A SOCIETY WE WISH OURS TO BECOME AND
WHICH OF THE CANDIDATES OR PARTIES IS THE MORE
LIKELY TO MOVE US TOWARD SUCH A SOCIETY.
IT IS DEPRESSING THAT IN THE POLICY SPEECHES
OF OUR LEADERS, AND IN THE PROPAGANDA SO
GENEROUSLY THROWN AROUND DURING ELECTIONS, WE
HEAR VERY LITTLE OF ANY SUCH IDEALS AS THE GENERAL
GOOD. IT IS PRESUMABLY CONSIDERED THAT THE
ELECTORATE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED IN SUCH A
VIEW OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.
INSTEAD WE ARE OFFERED PAY-OFFS TO VESTED
INTERESTS OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER, PROMISES TO
LOCAL ELECTORATES OF SWIMMING POOLS AND LIBRARIES
FOR THEIR SPECIAL BENEFIT AND - WORSE THAN THAT
- A MOUNTING STREAM OF ABUSE OF THEIR
OPPONENTS.
CAN POLITICIANS NEVER BE BROUGHT TO REALISE
THAT THE MUD WHICH THEY THROW NOT ONLY IS LIKELY
TO STICK TO THEIR OWN FINGERS BUT ALSO DEBASES
THE WHOLE PROFESSION WHICH MOST OF THEM ONCE
ENTERED FROM THE HIGHEST OF MOTIVES?
ELECTIONS SHOULD PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY OF
ELEVATING THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT,
NOT OF DEBASING IT FURTHER BY EMPHASISING THE
CONFLICTING SELF-INTEREST OF ITS COMPONENT PARTS.
OR ARE WE ALL SO RAPT IN OUR OWN DESIRE FOR MORE
THAT WE SEE DEMOCRACY AS A UNIVERSAL PROVIDER
RATHER THAN AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE IN
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WHOLE NATION?
<F15>
TUESDAY 7 OCTOBER 1980
"THE POLLS AND THE ELECTION"
POLITICS REMAINS AN UNPREDICTABLE GAME.
THAT IS THE LESSON OF THE LATEST OPINION
POLLS SHOWING LABOR AHEAD OF THE COALITION
PARTIES WITH THE ELECTION ONLY THREE WEEKS
AWAY. UNTIL A WEEK AGO IT HAD SEEMED TO MANY
POLITICIANS AND PUNDITS THAT THE ELECTION RESULT
WAS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH THE
LIBERALS WOULD WIN BY, AND WHETHER THEY
WOULD RETAIN THEIR MAJORITY IN THE SENATE.
PRIVATELY, EVEN LABOR MPS SHARED THE GENERAL
VIEW THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH DISSATISFACTION
AMONG THE VOTERS, OR ATTRACTION TO THE LABOR
ALTERNATIVE, TO PUT THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF IN
JEOPARDY. THAT ASSUMPTION HAS NOW BEEN
PUNCTURED BY AN AGE POLL SHOWING A SWING
TO LABOR OF MORE THAN 10 PER CENT - A VOTE
WHICH, IF REPEATED AT THE ELECTION ON SATURDAY
WEEK, WOULD PUT LABOR IN POWER WITH A
COMFORTABLE MAJORITY. SUDDENLY THE ELECTION IS A
TWO-HORSE RACE.
AN OPINION POLL IS NOT AN ELECTION. IN THE
THREE WEEKS BETWEEN THE TAKING OF OUR POLL
AND THE ELECTION DAY, MUCH COULD HAPPEN TO
CHANGE THE MINDS OF VOTERS. FOR ONE THING, THE
POLL FOUND THAT A MAJORITY OF INTENDING LABOR
VOTERS WERE EXPECTING THE LIBERALS TO WIN THE
ELECTION; PERHAPS MANY OF THOSE VOTERS WHO
HAVE SWUNG TO LABOR HAVE DONE SO AT LEAST
PARTLY AS A PROTEST VOTE AGAINST A GOVERNMENT
THEY EXPECT TO REMAIN IN OFFICE. IT MAY BE THAT
BY ELECTION DAY SOME OF THESE WILL HAVE
RETURNED TO THE CONSERVATIVE FOLD OR CHOSEN THE
DEMOCRATS AS A HALF-WAY HOUSE. INDEED, TWO
POLLS TAKEN AT THE SAME STAGE OF THE 1977
CAMPAIGN ALSO SHOWED LABOR IN FRONT, ALTHOUGH
BY ONLY NARROW MARGINS; YET IN THE FINAL THREE
WEEKS THE COALITION INCREASED ITS VOTE BY 5
PER CENT TO SCORE AN EASY WIN. BUT THE
LIBERALS' COMEBACK IN 1977 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
DUE TO THE VOTERS' AVERSION TO MR WHITLAM AND
TO THE ATTRACTION OF THE LIBERALS' PROMISE OF
TAX CUTS. THIS TIME IT IS LABOR THAT IS OFFERING
THE TAX CUTS, AND MR HAYDEN, WHILE UNINSPIRING
TO SOME, IS NOT THE SORT OF LEADER WHO IS LIKELY
TO SCARE OFF THE VOTERS.
CHANGES APPEAR TO HAVE HAPPENED OUT
THERE IN THE ELECTORATE WITHOUT THE POLITICIANS
REALISING IT. POLLS SUGGEST THAT ONE KEY REASON
IS ALMOST CERTAINLY THE UNPOPULARITY OF THE
PRIME MINISTER, MR FRASER. THE PRIME MINISTER
HAS LONG TRIED TO MAKE A VIRTUE OF HIS AUSTERE
IDEOLOGY BY PRESENTING HIMSELF AS A KIND OF
STERN HEADMASTER TAKING TOUGH ACTION TO KEEP
THE SCHOOL IN ORDER. BUT WHEN HIS POLICIES
DELIVER LOWER INFLATION AT THE COST OF LOWER
GROWTH AND HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, IT IS NOT
SURPRISING THAT THE ELECTORATE LOOKS FOR AN
ALTERNATIVE.
THE LABOR CAMPAIGN APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN
GOING WELL - SO FAR. FOR THE PAST 18 MONTHS
THE ALP HAS TRIED TO RID ITSELF OF THE IMAGE
OF THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT AND ITS ERRATIC,
DISASTER-PRONE AMBITIONS OF CHANGING AUSTRALIA.
LABOR HAS TRIED TO MARKET ITSELF TO THE VOTERS
AS A HUMANE AND SENSIBLE TEAM OF MANAGERS
WHO WILL ATTEND TO SOCIETY'S SORE SPOTS WHILE
KEEPING THE WHEELS OF INDUSTRY MOVING. AS A
MARKETING EXERCISE, IT SEEMS TO BE SUCCEEDING:
THE AUSTRALIAN FLAG, THE HAYDEN-HAWKE-WRAN
TROIKA, THE APPARENT RESTRAINT AND CLEVER
POPULISM OF ITS POLICIES, ALL HAVE PRESENTED
THE VOTERS WITH A SENSE OF REASSURANCE. THE
DECLINE IN THE VOTE FOR THE MINOR PARTIES IN
OUR POLL SUGGESTS LABOR IS GETTING THROUGH TO
THE SWINGING VOTERS.
IT MAY NOT BE EASY FOR THE LIBERALS TO WIN
THEM BACK AGAIN. THE LIBERAL POLICY SPEECH
CONVEYED THE IMPRESSION THAT THE GOVERNMENT
HAS LITTLE NEW TO OFFER. A SCAREMONGERING
CAMPAIGN AGAINST LABOR AND THE DEMOCRATS
- MR FRASER USED THE WORD "SOCIALIST" 19
TIMES IN A SHORT SPEECH AT PAKENHAM
RACECOURSE ON SUNDAY - COULD BE COUNTER-
PRODUCTIVE. IF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO REGAIN
THE INITIATIVE IN THE 12 DAYS REMAINING, IT WILL
BE ONLY BY ADDRESSING ITSELF TO THE PROBLEMS
WHICH SEEM TO BE ON VOTERS' MINDS -
UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, DECLINING LIVING
STANDARDS AND ECONOMIC INSECURITY - AND BY
ARTICULATING POLICIES WHICH CAN TACKLE THEM
EFFECTIVELY.
"PREDICTABLE WIN FOR MR SCHMIDT"
THERE WAS NEVER MUCH DOUBT THAT CHANCELLOR
SCHMIDT AND HIS RULING COALITION WOULD BE
RETURNED FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS IN SUNDAY'S
WEST GERMAN ELECTION. THE ELECTORATE HAD SHOWN
A CLEAR AND CONSISTENT PREFERENCE FOR MR SCHMIDT
FOR MONTHS. THAT, AND THE FACT THAT THERE WERE
NO REAL ISSUES, PROVIDED A CAMPAIGN WHICH FAILED
TO RAISE MUCH INTERNATIONAL DUST. TRUE, THE
CAMPAIGN CAUSED MUCH HEAT IN THE FEDERAL
REPUBLIC ITSELF, BUT AMONG THE POLITICIANS AND
NOT THE PEOPLE. INDEED IT COULD BE SAID THAT
THE PEOPLE HAD SHOWN THEMSELVES TO BE MORE
MATURE THAN THEIR LEADERS, WHO INDULGED
THEMSELVES IN PERHAPS THE DIRTIEST AND MOST
PERSONAL CAMPAIGN IN WEST GERMANY'S HISTORY.
ONLY HANS-DIETRICH GENSCHER, LEADER OF THE
FREE DEMOCRATS, EMERGED WITH HIS DIGNITY INTACT
AFTER A TELEVISED DEBATE BETWEEN THE PARTY
PRINCIPALS LAST WEEK. PERHAPS THAT IS A REASON
WHY THE FREE DEMOCRATS PERFORMED SO WELL
ON SUNDAY TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR POSITION AS
MINORITY COALITION PARTNER, THUS CONTINUING TO
PROTECT THE CONSERVATIVE MR SCHMIDT FROM THE
LEFT WING OF HIS OWN SOCIAL DEMOCRATS. ALTHOUGH
THE SDP MADE ONLY MODEST GAINS, THE
CHANCELLOR HAS ENHANCED HIS REPUTATION AS
PERHAPS THE MOST CAPABLE LEADER IN THE WESTERN
WORLD. HIS STRONG AND PRAGMATIC POLITICAL STYLE
APPEALS TO WEST GERMANS RIGHT ACROSS PARTY
LINES.
IT IS A FORMULA FOR SUCCESS IN A COUNTRY
THAT IS DEEPLY CONSCIOUS OF ITS SENSITIVE POSITION
IN EUROPE AND THE NEED FOR SECURITY. MR
SCHMIDT'S OPPONENT, THE UNPREDICTABLE AND BAD-
TEMPERED FRANZ JOSEF STRAUSS, COULD NEVER MATCH
THE CHANCELLOR'S CONSISTENCY. INDEED, MR STRAUSS
FOUND HIMSELF FRUSTRATED AT EVERY ATTEMPT TO
EXTEND HIS EARTHY, BAVARIAN APPEAL TO THE NORTH.
HE SUCCEEDED ONLY IN SHARPENING THE DEFINITION
BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH. HIS ATTACK ON THE HIGH
NATIONAL DEBT TOWARDS THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN
SUCCEEDED ONLY IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT
THAT THE RULING COALITION HAS KEPT INFLATION TO A
MERE 5 PER CENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT TO ONLY 4
PER CENT.
THE BIG QUESTION IN WEST GERMANY TODAY
IS WHERE THE 65-YEAR-OLD LOSER CAN GO FROM HERE.
IT HAS LONG BEEN MADE CLEAR TO HIM THAT HIS
LEADERSHIP OF THE CHRISTIAN PARTIES WAS FOR THE
DURATION OF THE ELECTION ONLY. OF COURSE, MR
STRAUSS IS STILL PRIME MINISTER OF BAVARIA. HE
HAS A SEAT IN BONN'S UPPER HOUSE AND A SEAT
IN THE BUNDESTAG. BUT IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT
THE VOTE LAST SUNDAY HAS SPELLED AN END TO HIS
DAYS AS A NATIONAL FIGURE. THE ECOLOGICAL
GREEN PARTY, WHICH ONCE LOOKED LIKE TIPPING THE
SCALES TO MR STRAUSS, TORE ITSELF TO BITS LONG
BEFORE POLLING DAY. BY THE TIME OF THE NEXT
ELECTION, IN 1984, THE DEMOCRAT PARTIES WILL HAVE
BEEN IN POWER FOR 15 YEARS. FOUR YEARS ARE A
LONG TIME IN POLITICS BUT SOME WEST GERMANS
ARE TALKING ABOUT "SWEDENISATION" - THE
PROSPECT OF INDEFINITE RULE.
<F16>
WEDNESDAY 8 OCTOBER 1980
"POLL BAN SHOULD BE REPEALED"
AT MIDNIGHT NEXT WEDNESDAY, 56 HOURS BEFORE
AUSTRALIANS BEGIN TO CAST THEIR VOTES IN THE
FEDERAL ELECTION, RADIO AND TELEVISION COVERAGE
OF THE PARTIES' CAMPAIGNS MUST END. AN ABSURD
DISCRIMINATORY LAW DECREES IT. NEWSPAPERS AND
MAGAZINES WILL CONTINUE THEIR COVERAGE, BUT
RADIO AND TELEVISION WILL BE PROHIBITED BY A
SECTION OF THE BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION ACT
FROM TRANSMITTING ANY POLITICAL NEWS, DISCUSSION,
COMMENTARIES, OR ADVERTISING. THE CAMPAIGNS
MAY BE AT THEIR HEIGHT. A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION
OF THE ELECTORATE MAY NOT HAVE DECIDED HOW TO
VOTE. BUT FOR RADIO AND TELEVISION, THE ELECTION
WILL BE OVER.
ALTHOUGH THE LAW ENCROACHES ON THE PUBLIC'S
RIGHT TO KNOW AND HAMPERS THE ELECTORAL
PROCESS, NEITHER MAJOR PARTY SEEMS INCLINED TO
ABOLISH IT. ONLY THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS
OPPOSE IT UNCONDITIONALLY. THE GOVERNMENT HAS
CONSIDERED ABOLITION, BUT DECIDED AGAINST IT. THE
LABOR PARTY WILL NOT OPPOSE THE BAN UNTIL
PUBLIC FUNDING OF ELECTION CAMPAIGNS IS
INTRODUCED AND THE AMOUNT OF ADVERTISING BY
PARTIES LIMITED. LABOR ARGUES THAT THE
CONSERVATIVE PARTIES, WITH BIGGER ADVERTISING
BUDGETS, CAN AFFORD TO BLITZ RADIO AND TELEVISION
ON ELECTION EVE IN A BID FOR THE VOTES OF
UNDECIDED ELECTORS. THE GOVERNMENT, SOME OF
WHOSE SPOKESMEN CONTINUE TO PUSH THE PECULIAR
LINE THAT VOTERS SHOULD BE GIVEN A REST FROM
POLITICAL NEWS BEFORE AN ELECTION, SEEMS TO FEAR
AN UNANSWERABLE LOW PUNCH FROM LABOR JUST AS
VOTERS GO TO THE POLLS. SO THE LAW IS RETAINED TO
SUIT THE PARTIES.
EACH SIDE HAS ITS DISSIDENTS. A SURVEY BY
MELBOURNE BROADCASTER DERRYN HINCH, WHO
INTENDS BREAKING THE BLACKOUT LAW NEXT WEEK,
SHOWS THAT MANY PARLIAMENTARIANS, MAINLY
BACKBENCHERS, FROM BOTH SIDES OPPOSE THE LAW.
AMONG THEM ARE THE DEPUTY OPPOSITION LEADER,
MR BOWEN, AND THE GOVERNMENT WHIP IN THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, MR BOUCHIER. BUT OF
THOSE WHO REPLIED TO MR HINCH'S QUESTIONNAIRE
AND SUPPORTED THE BAN, THERE WAS A MARKED
PREDOMINANCE OF GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND
LABOR SHADOW MINISTERS.
WHY DO NOT RADIO AND TELEVISION
MANAGEMENTS MAKE MORE FUSS? THEY MAY HAVE
MADE THEIR FEELINGS KNOWN TO THE GOVERNMENT
IN PRIVATE. BUT, APART FROM THE PERSONAL
CAMPAIGN CONDUCTED BY MR HINCH, THERE HAVE
BEEN FEW ATTEMPTS TO ALERT THE PUBLIC TO THE
SILLINESS OF THE LAW. THE JOB HAS BEEN LEFT TO
THE NEWSPAPERS. THE LAW SHOULD BE REPEALED.
BUT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, IT LOOKS AS IF RADIO AND
TELEVISION MANAGEMENTS - GIVEN THE
STUBBORNNESS OF THE POLITICIANS - WILL FIRST HAVE
TO SHOW MORE FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHT TO PROVIDE
NEWS AND VIEWS TO THE VOTERS. PERHAPS THEY
SHOULD ALL AGREE TO EXTEND THE BAN TO THREE
WEEKS NEXT TIME, UNLESS THE POLITICIANS ABOLISH
IT. THAT MIGHT DO THE TRICK.
"ASIO SECRECY AND THE COURTS"
LAST WEEK'S DECISION BY MR JUSTICE WILSON
THAT THE PERFORMANCE BY ASIO OF ITS
FUNCTIONS CANNOT BE CHALLENGED IN THE COURTS
RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS BUT SHOULD NOT BE
OVERSTATED. WITHOUT SEEKING TO ANTICIPATE THE
RESULT OF AN APPEAL TO THE FULL HIGH COURT, IF ONE
IS TAKEN, IT CAN BE SAID THAT MR JUSTICE WILSON'S
READING OF THE ASIO ACT IS HARDLY SURPRISING.
AS HIS HONOR POINTED OUT, WHERE THE ACT
EXPRESSLY CONTEMPLATES LEGAL CHALLENGE (ADVERSE
SECURITY ASSESSMENTS OF INDIVIDUALS) IT LAYS DOWN
SAFEGUARDS FOR THE PROTECTION OF ASIO SECRECY.
IT IS, ON THE FACE OF THINGS, IMPROBABLE THAT
PARLIAMENT INTENDED ASIO TO BE OPEN TO LEGAL
CHALLENGE WITHOUT SUCH SAFEGUARDS IN OTHER
CONTEXTS FOR WHICH NO EXPRESS PROVISION IS MADE.
SIMILARLY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS (JUDICIAL
REVIEW) ACT EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES ASIO FROM ITS
SCOPE.
BUT IT GOES TOO FAR TO SUGGEST THAT PARLIAMENT
OR MR JUSTICE WILSON HAVE PLACED ASIO ABOVE
THE LAW. IT IS TRUE THAT ASIO HAS BEEN PLACED
BEYOND THE REACH OF THE ORDINARY COURTS. THE
PERSON PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING ASIO'S
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW IS ITS DIRECTOR-GENERAL.
THIS IS NOT AS SILLY AS IT SOUNDS. THE ACT RESTRICTS
THE PERSONS FROM WHOM THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL MAY
BE APPOINTED AND SETS OUT IN REASONABLY CLEAR
TERMS WHAT HIS DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE.
THE PROVISION THAT THE MINISTER CANNOT SUBSTITUTE
HIS OWN DISCRETION FOR THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL'S IS
A PRECAUTION AGAINST POLITICAL MANIPULATION OF
ASIO, NOT A DILUTION OF ITS ACCOUNTABILITY,
THROUGH THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL, TO THE GOVERNMENT
AND TO PARLIAMENT.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXEMPTION OF ASIO
FROM LAWS WHICH IMPINGE DIRECTLY UPON ITS
INTELLIGENCE - GATHERING ACTIVITIES (TELEPHONE
TAPPING, SEARCHES, INTERCEPTION OF MAIL) ITS
PERSONNEL REMAIN OTHERWISE JUST AS SUBJECT TO THE
GENERAL LAW OF THE LAND AS ANYONE ELSE. ANY
ASIO OFFICER WHO ATTEMPTS INCOME TAX FRAUD, OR
SETTING HIS NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE ON FIRE OR PUNCHING
A PASSER-BY ON THE NOSE WILL PROVE THE POINT
WITHOUT DIFFICULTY. EVEN THE EXEMPTIONS CAN BE
USED ONLY UNDER MINISTERIAL AUTHORITY, WHICH IS
BY NO MEANS ROUTINELY GRANTED.
EVERY DEMOCRACY WORTH THE NAME HAS TO
MAKE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW
AND NATIONAL SECURITY. THE ASIO ACT IS A
REASONABLE ATTEMPT AT A WORKABLE COMPROMISE.
CERTAINLY IT DEPENDS HEAVILY ON THE
DIRECTOR-GENERAL BEING OF HIGH CALIBRE. BUT THERE
IS NO POINT IN ASSUMING IN ADVANCE THAT PERSONS
IN HIGH OFFICE WILL BE INCOMPETENT OR CORRUPT.
WE ENTRUST OUR JUDICIARY WITH ENORMOUS POWERS
ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY ARE ABLE AND
INCORRUPTIBLE. WITHIN SENSIBLE LIMITS THE SAME
APPROACH SHOULD APPLY ELSEWHERE IN PUBLIC LIFE.
THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ASIO DOES
NOT NOW OPERATE WITHIN SENSIBLE LIMITS.
<F17>
THURSDAY 9 OCTOBER 1980
"BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUES?"
THE PRIME MINISTER SEEMS TO HAVE REALISED
THAT IT WAS IMPRUDENT OF HIM TO RAISE THE
SPECTRE OF 1975. MR FRASER YESTERDAY TRIED TO
PLAY DOWN HIS OFF-THE-CUFF RESPONSE TO BEING ASKED
WHETHER A LIBERAL-NCP MAJORITY IN THE SENATE
WOULD AGAIN BLOCK SUPPLY TO BRING DOWN A
LABOR GOVERNMENT. HE SAID: "IF CIRCUMSTANCES
EXISTED AS EXISTED IN 1975, I WOULD DO EVERYTHING
I COULD TO GET RID OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THAT
DAY". HAD HE BEEN LESS CANDID OR MORE ALERT
AT THE TIME, HE MIGHT HAVE SAID THAT THE SITUATION
WAS MOST UNLIKELY TO RECUR DURING THE NEXT
PARLIAMENT. IF THERE IS A STRONG ENOUGH SWING
TO SWEEP THE FRASER GOVERNMENT OUT OF OFFICE
ON 18 OCTOBER, THEN THE COALITION IS ALSO LIKELY
TO LOSE ITS MAJORITY IN THE SENATE (FROM 1 JULY,
WHEN THE NEW SENATORS TAKE THEIR SEATS) TO LABOR
AND THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS, WHO ARE PLEDGED
NOT TO BLOCK SUPPLY EVEN IN "REPREHENSIBLE
CIRCUMSTANCES". JUDGING BY HIS EFFORTS TO DEFUSE
THE ISSUE YESTERDAY, MR FRASER HAS NOW REALISED
THAT IT WAS, IN ANY CASE, A SERIOUS MISTAKE TO
REMIND THE PUBLIC OF HIS PART IN ONE OF THE MOST
DIVISIVE POLITICAL CRISES IN AUSTRALIA'S POLITICAL
HISTORY SINCE FEDERATION.
MR FRASER'S ILL-ADVISED COMMENT - AND HIS
SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPT TO RETREAT FROM IT - ALSO
SUGGEST THAT HIS CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN AFFECTED
BY THE SUCCESSION OF OPINION POLLS INDICATING
A SIGNIFICANT SWING TOWARDS THE LABOR PARTY.
WHETHER THIS TREND WILL BE SUSTAINED IN THE
ACTUAL VOTING REMAINS TO BE SEEN, BUT THE
GOVERNMENT NOW HAS A FIGHT ON ITS HANDS. AT THE
SAME TIME, THE LABOR PARTY, FEW OF WHOSE
LEADERS FELT A MONTH OR TWO AGO THAT THEY HAD
A GOOD CHANCE OF REGAINING OFFICE, CAN NOW
SCENT POSSIBLE VICTORY. THE ELECTORATE, TOO, IS
APPARENTLY TAKING A FRESH INTEREST IN THE
CAMPAIGN, AFTER HAVING BEEN MOSTLY CONVINCED
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REAL CONTEST. AS A RESULT,
THE CAMPAIGN HAS BECOME MORE ABRASIVE AND
ABUSIVE - AND LESS ILLUMINATING.
THE DESCENT BY BOTH SIDES TO PERSONAL
DENIGRATION AND INNUENDO IS PARTICULARLY
UNFORTUNATE, AND POSSIBLY COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.
FOR THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, MR ANTHONY,
TO DESCRIBE THE OPPOSITION LEADER, MR HAYDEN,
AS A "SQUEALING SISSY" IS NEITHER ACCURATE NOR
PERTINENT. THE QUALITIES OF LEADERSHIP OF THE
RESPECTIVE LEADERS ARE, OF COURSE, A VALID ISSUE,
BUT THIS IS HARDLY THE WAY TO DISCUSS THEM. FOR
MR HAYDEN TO CALL ON MR FRASER TO DISCLOSE
HIS TAX RETURNS SERVES TO IMPLY, WITHOUT
EVIDENCE, THAT THE PRIME MINISTER MAY BE
ENGAGED IN LEGAL TAX MINIMISATION. AGAIN, TAX
AVOIDANCE IS A MATTER FOR CONCERN AND LEGISLATIVE
ACTION, BUT IT WILL NOT BE SOLVED BY A FRANK
EXCHANGE OF TAX RETURNS BETWEEN THE PARTY
LEADERS.
WHILE THE INCREASING STRAIN OF A CLOSE FIGHT
AND THE ATTEMPT EVERY DAY TO FIND SOMETHING
NEW FOR THE FRONT PAGES AND NEWS BULLETINS
TEMPT THE LEADING CONTESTANTS INTO MUTUAL
MUD-SLINGING AND MISREPRESENTATION, THE GREAT
ISSUES FACING THE NATION ARE BEING EVADED OR
TREATED IN THE MOST SUPERFICIAL FASHION. THE
OPINION POLLS, AS IN 1977, HAVE POINTED TO
UNEMPLOYMENT AS THE LEADING ISSUE IN VOTERS'
MINDS. YET THE DEBATE SEEMS TO HAVE
DEGENERATED INTO AN ARGUMENT OVER THE
DESIRABILITY AND COST OF TEMPORARY JOB-CREATION
AND TRAINING SCHEMES. NEITHER SIDE HAS SERIOUSLY
FACED THE CHALLENGES OF STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT
AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND PROTECTION THAT
WILL HAVE TO BE MET EVEN IF THE CURRENT RECESSION
FADES. NEITHER SIDE HAS SHOWN THAT IT HAS A POLICY
FOR THE COMING RESOURCES BOOM TO ENSURE THAT
ITS IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND EXISTING INDUSTRY
IS RESPONSIBLY ABSORBED AND THAT ITS BENEFITS ARE
EQUITABLY SHARED BY THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY.
PROBLEMS OF POVERTY, HEALTH CARE, INDUSTRIAL
RELATIONS AND FEDERALISM, AMONG OTHERS, REQUIRE
DEEPER ATTENTION THAN THE GLOSSY GENERALISATIONS
AND POINT-SCORING THEY HAVE BEEN ACCORDED SO
FAR.
"THE PROFESSIONS AND TAX ETHICS"
TAX AVOIDANCE HAS BECOME A LUCRATIVE
INDUSTRY THAT SEEMS BEYOND THE WIT OF
GOVERNMENT TO SUPPRESS. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS A YEAR ARE LOST TO FEDERAL REVENUE,
MAKING INCOME TAX ALMOST OPTIONAL FOR A
PRIVILEGED FEW WHILE INCREASING THE BURDEN ON
THE MASS OF TAXPAYERS TO WHOM SUCH MEANS OF
DODGING ARE NOT OPEN. AS SOON AS THE
GOVERNMENT CLOSES ONE LOOPHOLE ANOTHER
IS OPENED. THIS COULD NOT HAPPEN
WITHOUT THE CONTRIVANCE OF SKILLED ACCOUNTANTS
AND LAWYERS, SOMETIMES WITH THE BENIGN
ENDORSEMENT OF THE HIGH COURT. TAX AVOIDANCE,
AS DISTINCT FROM TAX EVASION, IS NOT ILLEGAL. THOSE
WHO RESORT TO IT, NO MATTER HOW ELABORATE AND
ARTIFICIAL THEIR SCHEMES, ARE WITHIN THEIR LEGAL
RIGHTS. BUT AS BRITAIN'S LORD CHANCELLOR,
VISCOUNT SIMON, OBSERVED IN A NOTABLE CASE,
"THAT IS NO REASON WHY THEIR EFFORTS OR THOSE OF
THE PROFESSIONAL GENTLEMEN WHO ASSIST THEM IN
THE MATTER SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A
COMMENDABLE EXERCISE OF INGENUITY OR AS A
DISCHARGE OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP".
IT IS THEREFORE HEARTENING THAT THE INSTITUTE
OF CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS PROPOSES TO STOP ITS
MEMBERS PROMOTING OR HELPING TO PROMOTE
ARTIFICIAL TAX AVOIDANCE SCHEMES. A DRAFT
STATEMENT ON TAX ETHICS CALLS ON MEMBERS
TO ADOPT "A RESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE IN RELATION
TO ANY TAX ARRANGEMENTS". MORE SPECIFICALLY,
"A MEMBER SHALL NOT PROMOTE, OR ASSIST
IN THE PROMOTION OF, ANY SCHEMES OR
ARRANGEMENTS WHICH HAVE NO COMMERCIAL
JUSTIFICATION OTHER THAN THE AVOIDANCE OF TAX
THROUGH EXPLOITATION OF THE REVENUE LAWS". THE
PROPOSED CODE WILL BE OPEN FOR COMMENT AND
AMENDMENT UNTIL 31 JANUARY NEXT AND, IF
ADOPTED BY THE INSTITUTE'S NATIONAL COUNCIL,
WOULD BECOME BINDING ON ALL MEMBERS. THE
AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY OF ACCOUNTANTS IS ALSO
CONSIDERING WHETHER TO ISSUE A GUIDELINE
STATEMENT TO ITS MEMBERS ON TAX STANDARDS.
IT IS A PITY, HOWEVER, THAT THE LEGAL
PROFESSION APPARENTLY REMAINS RATHER LESS
CONCERNED ABOUT THE ETHICS OF TAX AVOIDANCE.
THE AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY OF LABOR LAWYERS,
WHOSE PRESIDENT IS SENATOR GARETH EVANS, HAS
TRENCHANTLY CRITICISED COLLEAGUES WHO DEVOTE
THEIR TALENTS TO TAX SCHEMES. BUT THE SECRETARY-
GENERAL OF THE LAW COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA
SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS NOT FOR LAWYERS TO BECOME
MORAL ARBITERS AND THAT THE CRITICISM SHOULD
BE DIRECTED AT CLIENTS INSTEAD. THERE SEEMS LITTLE
DOUBT THAT A LAWYER MAY PROPERLY ADVISE A CLIENT
ON THE LEGALITY OF A TAX SCHEME AND MAY NOT,
WITHOUT IMPROPRIETY, ADVISE HIM ON HOW TO
ESCAPE TAX ILLEGALLY. BUT WHETHER A LAWYER
SHOULD ENCOURAGE OR CONTRIVE TAX AVOIDANCE
SCHEMES THAT ARE WITHIN THE LAW ALTHOUGH
ETHICALLY DUBIOUS REMAINS A MATTER OF
CONTROVERSY AMONG LAWYERS. THE PROFESSION'S
PUBLIC ESTEEM WOULD RISE IF IT FOLLOWED THE LEAD
OF THE ACCOUNTANTS.

FRIDAY 10 OCTOBER 1980
"VARIETY SHOW IN PORTUGAL"
IT IS SIX YEARS SINCE A GROUP OF YOUNG ARMY
OFFICERS ENDED DICTATORSHIP IN PORTUGAL AND
PROPELLED THE LEFT TO POWER. TODAY, AFTER THE 5
OCTOBER ELECTION, IT MIGHT SEEM AS IF THE
"REVOLUTION OF THE FLOWERS" HAD NEVER HAPPENED.
PORTUGAL APPEARS TO BE DOUBLING BACK AFTER ITS
EXPERIENCES SINCE THE COUP, WITH A DOZEN
GOVERNMENTS RANGING FROM MILITARY JUNTAS
BACKED BY THE COMMUNISTS TO SHAKY COALITIONS
LED BY THE SOCIALISTS. FOR THE SECOND TIME IN
LESS THAN A YEAR THE COUNTRY'S SEVEN MILLION
VOTERS HAVE PLUMPED FOR A STABLE CONSERVATIVE
MAJORITY WITH UNABASHEDLY RIGHT-WING OPTIONS.
THE DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE GOVERNMENT IS ANTI-
COMMUNIST, PRO-NATO, PRO-EEC AND
COMMITTED TO RADICAL THATCHERITE REFORM. IT SEES
THREE STUMBLING BLOCKS: A MARXIST-INSPIRED
CONSTITUTION, A SOLDIER-PRESIDENT, AND THE
COUNCIL OF THE REVOLUTION. ALL THREE ARE
REMINDERS OF 1974. ALL THREE ARE NOW IN
JEOPARDY.
THE PRESIDENT, GENERAL EANES, IS THE ONE
REMAINING OBSTACLE TO THE PLANS OF THE PRIME
MINISTER, MR SA CARNEIRO, FOR CHANGING THE
CONSTITUTION. PRESIDENT EANES WILL BE UP FOR
RE-ELECTION IN DECEMBER WITH THE SUPPORT OF
THE LEFT. HE IS SEEN AS AN HONEST ALTHOUGH
UNIMAGINATIVE MAN WHOSE AIM HAS BEEN TO
BRIDGE THE GULF BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT. AS
SUCH HE WILL HE A HARD CANDIDATE FOR MR SA
CARNEIRO'S MAN TO BEAT. THE PORTUGUESE HAVE
A HABIT OF VOTING FOR THE MAN, NOT THE PARTY,
IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. AND UNTIL THEY MAKE
THEIR CHOICE AT THE END OF THE YEAR, THE SHAPE
OF PORTUGUESE POLITICS WILL BE UNCERTAIN. IF
GENERAL EANES LOSES, THE LEFT FEARS THAT THERE
WILL BE A RETURN TO DICTATORSHIP. IF GENERAL EANES
WINS, THE IMPULSIVE MR SA CARNEIRO HAS PROMISED
TO QUIT OFFICE. SUCH ACTION COULD DIVIDE HIS PARTY,
SPLIT THE UNEASY ALLIANCE AND REOPEN THE WAY FOR
A COALITION OF THE LEFT. DEMOCRACY IN PORTUGAL,
IT SEEMS, IS TOO MUCH OF A NOVELTY FOR THE VARIETY
SHOW IN LISBON TO BE OVER YET.
"TASKS FOR THE MAN OF ARTS"
MR PAUL CLARKSON HAS PLENTY OF PROBLEMS
AND CHALLENGES AHEAD AS HE TAKES OVER AS
DIRECTOR OF THE VICTORIAN MINISTRY FOR THE ARTS.
SEVERAL ARE CONCERNED WITH THE ST KILDA ROAD
ARTS CENTRE, DUE (ACCORDING TO THE LATEST
PREDICTION) TO BE IN FULL WORKING ORDER BY EARLY
1983 AS A PLACE FOR MUSIC, OPERA, DRAMA, DANCE
AND OTHER LIVE ENTERTAINMENT. IT WILL HOUSE SOME
ACCOMPLISHED AND ESTABLISHED PERFORMERS,
NOTABLY THE AUSTRALIAN BALLET, THE MELBOURNE
THEATRE COMPANY AND THE MELBOURNE SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA. AMONG ITS OTHER LIKELY OCCUPANTS
IS THE FLEDGLING VICTORIA STATE OPERA.
WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES IN OPERA
IS SOMETIMES CONSIDERABLY MORE OPERATIC THAN
THE PERFORMANCES ON STAGE. THE VICTORIA STATE
OPERA AND THE SYDNEY-BASED AUSTRALIAN OPERA,
FOR EXAMPLE, ACHIEVE THE FEAT OF BEING PRIVATELY
AT WAR WHILE IN PUBLIC PRESENTING THEMSELVES
AS ALLIES IN A JOINT-SUBSCRIPTION SEASON. MR
CLARKSON AND HIS MINISTER, MR LACY, WILL HAVE
TO BE FIRM IN ENSURING THAT OPERATIC DIFFERENCES
ARE RESOLVED IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT IMPOSE AN
UNFAIR BURDEN ON VICTORIAN TAXPAYERS, DOES NOT
STIFLE THE VSO AND DOES NOT DEPRIVE MELBOURNE
OF THE AUSTRALIAN OPERA'S MORE SPECTACULAR
ACHIEVEMENTS.
LESS BITTER RIVALRIES AMONG THE DRAMA
COMPANIES ALSO NEED WATCHING. THERE IS A DANGER
THAT THE MELBOURNE THEATRE COMPANY WILL,
WITHOUT INTENDING TO DO SO, ACHIEVE A POSITION
OF MONOPOLISTIC STRENGTH. WHEN IT MOVES INTO
THE ARTS CENTRE, SHOULD IT BE PUBLICLY FINANCED
TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO PERFORM
AT THE ATHENAEUM AND RUSSELL STREET AS WELL?
IF PLAYBOX AND THE AUSTRALIAN PERFORMING
GROUP - THE MTC'S COMPETITORS - ARE TO
REMAIN HEALTHY, SOME THOUGHT MUST BE GIVEN TO
THE SHARING OR REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES. AND,
ALTHOUGH THE PRINCESS DESERVES TO BE SUBSIDISED
INTO FURTHER USEFUL LIFE, MR CLARKSON SHOULD BE
WARY OF WASTING MONEY ON THE REGENT AND THE
PALAIS.
UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF DR ERIC WESTBROOK
AS FOUNDING DIRECTOR, THE MINISTRY FOR THE ARTS
HAS DONE MUCH TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY AND
AMATEUR ACTIVITIES. IT HAS ALSO ENRICHED THE LIVES
OF COUNTRY PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE
REGIONAL GALLERIES. THESE ARE MATTERS FOR
DEVELOPMENT DURING MR CLARKSON'S REIGN. A
FRESH LINE FOR HIM TO TAKE IS TO GIVE THE PUBLIC
A CLEARER VIEW OF HOW THE MINISTRY DECIDES ITS
PRIORITIES AND WHY. FOR THE GOVERNMENT, MR
CLARKSON'S EXPERIENCE IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND ITS
SPONSORSHIP OF THE ARTS WAS AMONG HIS
ATTRACTIONS AS A POTENTIAL DIRECTOR. BUT
GOVERNMENT FUNDING MUST REMAIN THE CHIEF
FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS. AT BEST, PRIVATE
PATRONAGE CAN PROVIDE NO MORE THAN THE
TRIMMINGS.
<F19>
MONDAY 13 OCTOBER 1980
"THE FUTURE OF THE SENATE"
THE PRIME MINISTER'S DECISION TO CONCENTRATE
THE LAST WEEK OF HIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN ON
VICTORIA BETRAYS AN ANXIETY THAT THE LIBERAL-NCP
GOVERNMENT MAY LOSE ITS MAJORITY IN THE SENATE,
AND EVEN ITS HOLD ON POWER. THE LABOR PARTY
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WIN CONTROL OF THE SENATE ON
SATURDAY, EVEN IF IT IS ELECTED AS THE GOVERNMENT.
BUT IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT THE AUSTRALIAN
DEMOCRATS, WITH PERHAPS THE INDEPENDENT
SENATOR HARRADINE, WILL GAIN THE BALANCE OF
POWER IN THE SENATE FROM 1 JULY WHEN THE
INCOMING SENATORS TAKE THEIR SEATS.
A LABOR GOVERNMENT WOULD FIND THIS
PROSPECT PREFERABLE TO A SENATE WHERE A HOSTILE
OPPOSITION COULD AGAIN OBSTRUCT ITS LEGISLATION
AND EVEN, AS MR FRASER LET SLIP LAST WEEK, BLOCK
SUPPLY TO FORCE IT PREMATURELY TO THE POLLS. NOT
THAT LABOR WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE A SMOOTH
PASSAGE FOR ALL ITS LEGISLATION IF SENATOR CHIPP
AND HIS COLLEAGUES HELD THE BALANCE. ALTHOUGH
THE DEMOCRATS SAY THEY WOULD TRY TO ENSURE THAT
THE GOVERNMENT (LIBERAL OR LABOR) KEEPS ITS
PROMISES, THEY WOULD NOT SUPPORT LABOR'S
PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE TAX AVOIDANCE THROUGH
RETROSPECTIVE LEGISLATION. BUT THEY ARE PLEDGED
NOT TO JOIN IN BLOCKING SUPPLY, AND COULD PREVENT
A REPETITION OF THE EVENTS OF 1975.
A RE-ELECTED FRASER GOVERNMENT WOULD FIND
A DEMOCRAT BALANCE IN THE SENATE IRKSOME BUT
NOT LETHAL. EVEN IF THE COALITION RETAINS A
MAJORITY IN BOTH HOUSES, THE SENATE IS LIKELY TO
BE MORE PRICKLY. GOVERNMENT SENATORS HAVE NOT
FORGOTTEN THE CONTROVERSIAL DISMISSAL OF THEIR
FORMER LEADER, SENATOR WITHERS, FROM CABINET,
OR THE DEMOTION OF A NCP MINISTER, SENATOR
SCOTT, TO MAKE ROOM IN THE MINISTRY FOR THE
RETURN OF MR IAN SINCLAIR. THIS MOVE REDUCED
THE NUMBER OF MINISTERS IN THE SENATE TO FOUR,
WHO HAD TO ANSWER NOT ONLY FOR THEIR OWN
PORTFOLIOS BUT TO REPRESENT THE 23 MINISTERS IN
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. MR FRASER WOULD
BE UNDER PRESSURE NOT ONLY TO INCREASE THE QUOTA
OF MINISTERS IN THE SENATE BUT ALSO TO  ALLOW
GOVERNMENT SENATORS TO ELECT THEIR OWN LEADER,
A STEP THAT WOULD ENHANCE THEIR INDEPENDENCE.
SO WHOEVER WINS THE ELECTION ON SATURDAY,
THE SENATE IS LIKELY TO ASSUME A MORE IMPORTANT
ROLE THAN IT HAS PLAYED SINCE IT PRECIPITATED THE
FALL OF THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT FIVE YEARS AGO.
IT IS WORTH REFLECTING ON WHAT THIS ROLE OUGHT
TO BE. GOVERNMENTS OF ANY COMPLEXION, OF
COURSE, PREFER TO HAVE A SENATE THAT IS
REASONABLY DOCILE AND AMENABLE TO PARTY
DISCIPLINE. BUT SENATORS, ALTHOUGH THEY SELDOM
EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE AS GUARDIANS OF
STATE INTERESTS IN THE FEDERAL COMPACT, HAVE
BEEN TAKING THEIR OTHER FUNCTION AS A HOUSE OF
REVIEW INCREASINGLY SERIOUSLY. THE LABOR PARTY
HAS MOVED FROM ITS FORMER AIM OF ABOLISHING THE
SENATE - AN UNREALISTIC OBJECTIVE, GIVEN THE
CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL OBSTACLES - TO A
POLICY OF ENHANCING ITS EFFECTIVENESS AS A HOUSE
OF REVIEW WHILE STRIPPING IT OF ITS POWER OF LIFE
AND DEATH OVER A GOVERNMENT.
THE SENATE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY OTHER
NATIONAL UPPER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT IN THE
WESTMINSTER SYSTEM. ELSEWHERE, IT IS SUFFICIENT
FOR A GOVERNMENT TO RETAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE
"POPULAR" HOUSE. ONLY IN AUSTRALIA CAN THE
UPPER HOUSE - THE SENATE - FORCE A
GOVERNMENT TO THE POLLS BY WITHHOLDING
APPROVAL FOR ITS PROPOSED EXPENDITURE, OR
THREATENING TO DO SO, WITHOUT NECESSARILY FACING
THE ELECTORS ITSELF. THIS PECULIARITY STEMS FROM
THE UNEASY MARRIAGE OF RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT
IN THE WESTMINSTER TRADITION TO THE FEDERAL
PRINCIPLE EMBRACED IN THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION.
FOR THIS REASON, THE SENATE IS ALSO LESS
DEMOCRATIC THAT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
IN THAT ALL STATES REGARDLESS OF THEIR POPULATIONS
ARE REPRESENTED BY AN EQUAL NUMBER OF SENATORS,
AND IN THAT THE TERMS OF STATE (BUT NOT TERRITORY)
SENATORS ARE STAGGERED. PARADOXICALLY, THE
SENATE'S VOTING SYSTEM OF PROPORTIONAL
REPRESENTATION IS IN ONE SENSE MORE DEMOCRATIC,
GIVING MINORITY PARTIES SUCH AS THE AUSTRALIAN
DEMOCRATS A CHANCE OF REPRESENTATION THEY ARE
DENIED IN THE LOWER HOUSE WITH ITS
SINGLE-MEMBER ELECTORATES.
THE SENATE'S POWER TO DESTROY A
GOVERNMENT IN MID-TERM IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE
REMOVED. AUSTRALIA'S PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY
COULD NOT EASILY ABSORB ANOTHER CRISIS OF THE
1975 KIND, EVEN WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF THE
GOVERNOR-GENERAL. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE  SEEMS
NO EARLY PROSPECT OF THE NECESSARY CONSENSUS
FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OR EVEN -
JUDGING BY MR FRASER'S COMMENT - OF A
GUARANTEED RETURN TO THE CONVENTION UPHELD FOR
MORE THAN 70 YEARS THAT THE SENATE SHOULD NOT
BLOCK SUPPLY. IN THE MEANTIME, THE HOPE MUST
BE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF 1974 AND 1975 WILL
NOT ARISE. AND THAT COULD DEPEND ON HOW PEOPLE
VOTE IN THE SENATE POLL ON SATURDAY.
WHATEVER THE STATE OF THE PARTIES IN THE
SENATE FROM 1 JULY, ITS EFFECTIVENESS AS A HOUSE
OF REVIEW SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED. THE SENATE
HAS ALREADY INCREASED ITS STATURE IN RECENT YEARS
WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF STANDING AND SELECT
COMMITTEES TO SCRUTINISE LEGISLATION, EXAMINE
REGULATIONS, CHECK EXPENDITURE AND INQUIRE INTO
MATTERS OF NATIONAL CONCERN. THERE IS NO REASON
WHY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD NOT
ALSO PLAY A MORE USEFUL ROLE IN COUNTERING THE
GROWING POWER OF EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT AND
BUREAUCRACY, BUT THE SENATE HAS MORE TIME AND
A GREATER DEGREE OF INDEPENDENCE. SOME SENATORS
ON BOTH SIDES HAVE PROPOSED THAT NO MINISTERS
BE APPOINTED FROM THE SENATE AND THAT THE
CHAMBER DEVOTE ITSELF ENTIRELY TO REVIEWING ALL
LEGISLATION IN DETAIL, WITH POWERS TO CALL FOR
OFFICIAL AND INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE. THE PROPOSAL
IS LIKELY TO MEET DETERMINED RESISTANCE FROM
GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR DEPARTMENTAL ADVISERS,
BUT IT IS WORTH DEEPER CONSIDERATION. MEANWHILE,
ANY STRENGTHENING OF PARLIAMENTARY SUPERVISION
OF EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT IS TO BE WELCOMED, SO
LONG AS IT DOES NOT AMOUNT TO POLITICAL
OBSTRUCTION AND DESTRUCTION. THE SENATE MUST
ALWAYS BE CONSCIOUS THAT ANY ABUSE OF ITS
POWERS WOULD REVIVE PRESSURES FOR ITS ABOLITION
OR NEUTERING.
<F20>
TUESDAY 14 OCTOBER 1980
"DISHONEST ADVERTISING"
ELECTORS HAVE TO PUT UP WITH A FAIR AMOUNT
OF BENDING OF THE TRUTH DURING ELECTION
CAMPAIGNS. POLITICIANS FROM ALL PARTIES TEND TO
GLOSS OVER SHORTCOMINGS ON THEIR SIDE AND DISTORT
THOSE ON THE OTHER TO TRY TO CONVINCE US THAT
GREY IS BLACK OR WHITE. THAT IS IN THE NATURE OF
THE GAME, AND ONE CAN ACCEPT IT. BUT THERE IS
NO EXCUSE FOR OUTRIGHT DISHONESTY IN ELECTION
ADVERTISING AND SPEECHES. AND THERE IS NO EXCUSE
FOR TWO ELECTION ADVERTISEMENTS THE LIBERAL
PARTY HAS BEEN RUNNING IN THE PRESS AND ON
RADIO AND TV. ONE OF THEM WARNS OF "LABOR'S
20 PER CENT INFLATION". THE OTHER SETS OUT
SUPPOSED DETAILS OF "LABOR'S 'WEALTH' TAX".
THE FIRST ADVERTISEMENT SAYS: "THREE YEARS
OF LABOR'S SPENDING WOULD CUT THE BUYING POWER
OF THE DOLLAR IN HALF - WITH 20 PER CENT
INFLATION". NO AUTHORITY FOR THIS PREDICTION IS
CITED. ONLY ONCE IN OUR HISTORY HAVE WE HAD
20 PER CENT INFLATION, AND THAT WAS UNDER A
LIBERAL-CP GOVERNMENT DURING THE KOREAN WAR
BOOM OF 1951-52. IT IS TRUE THAT LABOR'S ECONOMIC
POLICIES ARE MORE EXPANSIONARY THAN THOSE WE
COULD EXPECT FROM THE NEXT FRASER GOVERNMENT,
AND TO THAT EXTENT ARE LIABLE TO RISK INCREASED
INFLATION. IT IS FAIR PLAY FOR THE LIBERALS TO ARGUE
STRONGLY AGAINST THIS DANGER, AS THE TREASURER,
MR HOWARD, HAS BEEN DOING. BUT TO PLUCK A
FIGURE OUT OF THE AIR AND PRESENT IT AS FACT
IN AN ATTEMPT TO SCARE VOTERS IS DISHONEST
ADVERTISING. IT IS AKIN TO THE CLAIM BY LABOR
SPOKESMEN EARLIER IN THE CAMPAIGN THAT
THE FRASER GOVERNMENT WOULD REINTRODUCE
CONSCRIPTION IF RE-ELECTED. LABOR HAS DROPPED
THAT LIE SINCE. BUT IT STILL CLAIMS, IN AN
ADVERTISEMENT, THAT IT WOULD CUT PETROL PRICES,
WHEN IN FACT ALL IT PROPOSES IS TO FREEZE THEM.
A SECOND LIBERAL ADVERTISEMENT MAKES A
NUMBER OF FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT LABOR'S PLANS
FOR A WEALTH TAX AND CAPITAL GAINS TAX. IN
JULY, LABOR'S ECONOMIC SPOKESMAN, MR WILLIS,
ANNOUNCED THAT NO SUCH TAXES WOULD BE
INTRODUCED UNTIL AFTER A PUBLIC INQUIRY HAD
REPORTED ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IN
AUSTRALIA. LAST WEDNESDAY MR HAYDEN PLEDGED
NOT TO INTRODUCE ANY SUCH TAXES IN HIS FIRST
TERM IN OFFICE. SINCE THEN THE LIBERAL PARTY HAS
RUN A SERIES OF ADVERTISEMENTS STATING: "LABOR
IS COMMITTED TO A NEW TAX WHICH WOULD HIT
MIDDLE-INCOME EARNERS JUST AS VIOLENTLY AS THE
WEALTHY. THIS SO-CALLED 'WEALTH' TAX WOULD
STEAL THE SAVINGS OF PEOPLE... IT WOULD ATTACK
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES
WHO OWN MODEST HOMES... IF YOU SELL YOUR
HOUSE TO BUY ANOTHER, EVEN IF YOUR HOUSE HAS
ONLY INCREASED BY THE VALUE OF INFLATION, THEN
YOU WOULD PAY A CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON THAT..."
NOT ONE OF THESE CLAIMS IS TRUE. IT WAS
DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR MR FRASER EXPANDING THEM
YESTERDAY IN THE CITY SQUARE. IT IS FAIR COMMENT
TO POINT OUT THAT MR HAYDEN'S PLEDGE LEAVES
LABOR WITHOUT ANY TAX PROPOSALS TO FUND ITS
SPENDING PLANS; AND AGAIN, MR HOWARD HAS DONE
SO ASSIDUOUSLY. IT IS ANOTHER THING TO INVENT A
HYPOTHESIS AND PRESENT IT AS FACT IN ORDER TO
SCARE VOTERS INTO CHANGING THEIR MINDS. THESE
ADVERTISEMENTS, AUTHORISED BY THE LIBERALS'
FEDERAL SECRETARY, MR TONY EGGLETON, ARE
UNWORTHY OF A PARTY SEEKING TO GOVERN THE
COUNTRY. THEY SHOULD BE DROPPED.
"MAKING ROOM FOR THE PUBLIC"
THE AIRWAVES ARE PUBLIC PROPERTY. TRUE,
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS TEND TO DOMINATE THEM
AND, AT TIMES, APPEAR TO WANT TO MONOPOLISE
THEM. BUT, PUT SIMPLY, THE AIRWAVES SHOULD BE
ACCESSIBLE TO ANY GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN
DEMONSTRATE A NEED TO USE THEM AND WHO ARE
WILLING TO USE THEM RESPONSIBLY. IN THE PAST
DECADE, AUSTRALIA HAS GONE SOME WAY TO MAKING
THE AIRWAVES ACCESSIBLE. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
AND COMMON-INTEREST GROUPS HAVE BEEN GIVEN
RADIO LICENCES. IN ONE CASE, A NUMBER OF
COMMUNITY GROUPS, INCLUDING TRADE UNIONS AND
ETHNIC ORGANISATIONS, ESTABLISHED A COMMUNITY
RADIO STATION, 3CR, WHOSE FACILITIES THEY SHARE.
NOW, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS INDICATED
THAT SOME TELEVISION FREQUENCIES MAY BE
ALLOCATED TO COMMUNITY AND EDUCATION GROUPS
WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO. THE LABOR PARTY SAYS IT
ALSO WILL ISSUE PUBLIC TELEVISION LICENCES IF
ELECTED ON SATURDAY.
PUBLIC TELEVISION'S POTENTIAL IN PROVIDING
EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, PARTICULARLY TERTIARY
COURSES TO ADULTS WHO WISH TO STUDY PART-TIME
AT HOME, IS IMMENSE. IT COULD PROVIDE AN OUTLET
FOR AMATEUR THEATRE GROUPS, MUSICIANS, FILM
MAKERS, AND OTHERS WHO CANNOT GET ACCESS TO
EXISTING CHANNELS. BUT THE PROBLEMS OF
ESTABLISHING IT ARE ALSO IMMENSE. THE COST OF
ESTABLISHING STUDIOS AND TRANSMITTERS IS HUGE.
IT COULD BE THAT NO ONE, NOT EVEN MAJOR TERTIARY
INSTITUTIONS, WILL HAVE THE NECESSARY CASH. THERE
IS LIKELY TO BE A PROTRACTED DEBATE BETWEEN THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMERCIAL TELEVISION
INDUSTRY OVER THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC STATIONS THAT
WILL BE LICENSED AND THE TYPES OF PROGRAMME
THEY WILL BE ALLOWED TO TRANSMIT.
THESE PROBLEMS ARE NOT INSURMOUNTABLE. AS
LONG AS PUBLIC TELEVISION IS NOT ALLOWED TO
IMITATE THE OTHER SORTS AND CONCENTRATES ON
THOSE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS CREATED, THERE
SHOULD BE NO CONFLICT. THE FINANCIAL QUESTION IS
THORNIER. ONE ANSWER MIGHT BE FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW A NUMBER OF GROUPS TO
JOIN FORCES TO ESTABLISH A STATION, AS WITH 3CR.
ANOTHER MIGHT BE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO
ESTABLISH STUDIOS AND TRANSMITTERS THAT CAN BE
RENTED FOR AN HOUR OR TWO EACH WEEK TO THOSE
WHO WANT ACCESS BUT WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY
THEIR OWN. RELIGIOUS, PROFESSIONAL, AND SMALL
ARTISTIC GROUPS WOULD FIT INTO THIS CATEGORY. IN
THE CASE OF EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION, THERE COULD
BE A GOOD CASE FOR THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDING
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO STATIONS OWNED AND
OPERATED IN EACH CAPITAL CITY BY A CONSORTIUM
OF TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS.
REMEMBERING THE DISPUTES OVER COMMUNITY
RADIO, ONE DOES NOT ENVY THE JOB OF THOSE WHO
WOULD HAVE TO SORT OUT THE ROWS OVER PUBLIC
TELEVISION. STILL, THE IDEA IN PRINCIPLE IS RIGHT.
BUT THE WAY IT HAS BEEN SUDDENLY REVEALED IN
THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN ILLUSTRATES
ONCE AGAIN THE NATION'S LACK OF A COHERENT
COMMUNICATIONS POLICY.
<F21>
WEDNESDAY 15 OCTOBER 1980
"VERDICT ON MR FRASER"
FORGET THE RALLIES, THE SHOUTING, THE SLOGANS
AND THE ADVERTISEMENTS, FOR THERE IS NO TRUTH
THERE. DISCOUNT THE PARTY LEADERS, BECAUSE THEY
SPEAK UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE OPINION POLLS
AND THEIR REMARKS BEAR ONLY A DISTANT CONNECTION
TO WHAT THEY MIGHT DO IN OFFICE. WATCH THE
PROMISES AND THREATS, HOWEVER, BECAUSE EVEN
FALSE ARGUMENTS CAN, WHEN THEY COME FROM BOTH
SIDES, YIELD A ROUGH KIND OF TRUTH. AND LOOK,
MOST OF ALL, AT THE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY OF WHAT
YOU HEAR.
THIS IS OUR GENERAL GUIDE TO HOW TO VOTE.
WE INTEND, TODAY AND TOMORROW, TO JUDGE MR
FRASER AND MR HAYDEN AGAINST IT.
WE FEEL WE CAN HELP YOU BETTER BY ADVISING
YOU HOW TO DECIDE THAN BY TRYING TO TELL YOU HOW
TO VOTE. AS WE SAID AT THE OUTSET, A NEWSPAPER
HAS NO VOTE: IF IT DID, WE SHOULD FIND IT HARD TO
REACH A DECISION. OUR BEST AIM CAN PERHAPS BE
"TO HAVE SQUEEZED THE UNIVERSE INTO A BALL AND
TO ROLL IT TOWARDS SOME OVERWHELMING QUESTION",
IN THE WORDS OF J.ALFRED PRUFROCK.
TODAY, MR FRASER. THE BEST THING YOU CAN
SAY FOR HIM IS: DO NOT JUDGE HIM BY HIS
ILL-ADVISED CAMPAIGN. IT STRAINS CHARITY TO DO SO,
BUT WE DO SUGGEST TO THE INTELLIGENTLY SWINGING
VOTER THAT HE DISREGARD MR FRASER'S STRIDENCY
AND DISTORTIONS. WHILE IT NO DOUBT REFLECTS ON HIS
ABILITY TO HANDLE PRESSURE, IT SAYS LITTLE OR
NOTHING ABOUT HOW HE WOULD HANDLE ANOTHER
THREE YEARS AS PRIME MINISTER.
TO JUDGE THAT, WE MUST LOOK AT HIS
DISTINCTIVE RECORD AND HIS MODEST PROMISES. IT
IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED, AT
THE COST OF CONSIDERABLE UNPOPULARITY, TO GET TWO
FUNDAMENTALS RIGHT: THE GOVERNMENT DEFICIT AND
THE PETROL PRICE. WE SHALL GO INTO THIS AT GREATER
LENGTH TOMORROW, BUT WE ARE BOUND TO SAY NOW,
ON BOTH THESE COUNTS, THAT WE VERY MUCH PREFER
THE GOVERNMENT'S RECORD TO THE OPPOSITION'S
PROMISES. NO PROGRAMME TO GET AUSTRALIA
THROUGH THE 'EIGHTIES COULD IGNORE THEM.
THE TROUBLE LIES IN WHAT THE GOVERNMENT
HAS NOT DONE. IT HAS NOT TURNED ITS BALANCED
BUDGET INTO AN ANTI-INFLATION POLICY AND IT HAS
NOT TURNED ITS COURAGEOUS IMPORT-PARITY PRICE FOR
OIL INTO A RESOURCES POLICY. THUS HAVE THE
GOVERNMENT'S STRENGTHS BECOME ITS WEAKNESSES.
THE GOVERNMENT IS RIGHT THAT THE RESOURCES BOOM
IS LIKELY TO BE THE SHAPING EVENT OF THE 'EIGHTIES
FOR AUSTRALIA. THE TREASURY HAS POINTED OUT THE
PROBLEM. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE
POLICIES TO COPE WITH IT.
MR FRASER IS AN ENTHUSIASTIC DISPENSER OF
THE TREASURY'S MEDICINE TO LABOR, BUT HE DRAWS
BACK FROM GIVING IT TO CAPITAL. THAT IS THE ONLY
CONSTRUCTION THAT CAN BE PUT ON HIS DISMISSAL,
AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB YESTERDAY, OF THE IDEA
THAT WE MAY BE SELLING OUR RESOURCES TOO CHEAP.
THE TREASURY HAS CRITICISED THE INFRASTRUCTURE
PROGRAMME OF MR FRASER'S GOVERNMENT, AND IT
IS A PRETTY POOR RESPONSE FOR A PRIME MINISTER
TO SAY - AS MR FRASER DID - THAT THIS IS A PIECE
OF ADVICE THE GOVERNMENT CHOSE NOT TO FOLLOW.
NOR DID MR FRASER HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY
TOWARDS THE FEARS - FELT AS MUCH IN THE BUSINESS
COMMUNITY AS ANYWHERE ELSE - ABOUT HOW
FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO THE TUNE OF $29 BILLION,
OR ANYTHING LIKE IT, MIGHT BE FITTED INTO THE
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY WITHOUT ITS PROBLEMS
OUTWEIGHING ITS BENEFITS. HE DID NOT, TO BE
SPECIFIC, ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PROTECTION IN THE
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY. IT IS A QUESTION MR FRASER
WISHES TO DODGE.
IF HE HAD A COMPREHENSIVE STATEMENT ABOUT
HOW HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD HANDLE RESOURCES
INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT, WE WOULD BE ABLE
TO REACH A FIRMER JUDGMENT ON HIS CLAIM TO OFFICE.
AS IT IS, MR FRASER HAS MADE IT ALMOST AS MUCH
AN ACT OF FAITH TO VOTE FOR THE GOVERNMENT AS IT
NECESSARILY IS TO VOTE FOR THE OPPOSITION. THIS IS
WHAT WORRIES US MOST: THE GOVERNMENT'S FUZZY
AND NAIVE VIEW OF THE FUTURE.
YOU CANNOT SAY FROM MR FRASER'S SPEECH
YESTERDAY, OR HIS CAMPAIGN SO FAR, THAT HIS
GOVERNMENT HAS ANYTHING MORE THAN THE VAGUEST
OF IDEAS ABOUT HOW THE NARROW WEALTH FROM
RESOURCES WILL BE CAPTURED FOR AUSTRALIA. MR
FRASER SPEAKS OF A 46 CENTS IN THE DOLLAR FEDERAL
TAX TAKE WHEN THE STATES - INCLUDING
GOVERNMENTS OF HIS COLOR - ARE BUSILY
REIMBURSING COMPANIES FOR EVEN THIS MODEST
IMPEDIMENT TO THE REPATRIATION OF PROFITS THEY
MIGHT WIN IN AUSTRALIA.
YOU CANNOT SAY THE GOVERNMENT HAS MUCH
OF AN IDEA HOW WHATEVER WEALTH IT DOES MANAGE
TO CAPTURE MIGHT BE USED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF _ALL_
AUSTRALIANS. MR FRASER DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH
TO SAY ABOUT THE LOT OF THE UNEMPLOYED. HE DOES
NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO SAY ABOUT AUSTRALIA'S PLACE
IN THE WORLD (HIS POLICY ON POL POT WILL BE
DISCUSSED SEPARATELY TOMORROW).
FINALLY, MR FRASER DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO
SAY ABOUT ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. HIS ANSWERS
ON THE GOVERNMENT'S UNFORTUNATE ATTEMPTS TO
HOLD DOWN INTEREST RATES ARE TOO COY. CUTTING
GOVERNMENT IS THE HARDEST TASK, AND WE DON'T
IMAGINE ANOTHER GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE DONE
MORE. BUT MR FRASER HAS NOT DONE SO MUCH AS
WOULD ALLOW A NEUTRAL JUDGE TO CALL HIM A
SMALL-GOVERNMENT MAN. HE HAS APPLIED A BLOATED
PETROL TAX TO A BIG GOVERNMENT, AND THAT DOES
NOT MAKE EVEN TWO-FIFTHS OF AN ECONOMIC POLICY.
IT MUST BE SAID THAT FIVE YEARS OF FRASER
GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN INFINITELY BETTER THAN FIVE
MORE YEARS OF UNRESTRAINED WHITLAMISM. BUT
MR FRASER IS RUNNING, NOT AGAINST MR WHITLAM,
BUT AGAINST MR HAYDEN. IF MR FRASER HAD MORE
TO SAY ABOUT THE FUTURE, HE WOULD NOT NEED TO
DWELL SO MUCH ON THE PAST. AS FOR MR HAYDEN,
HIS OFFERINGS WILL BE EXAMINED TOMORROW.
"POLITICAL ADS AND 'THE AGE'"
IN AN EDITORIAL YESTERDAY, 'THE AGE' SAID THAT
TWO LIBERAL PARTY ADVERTISEMENTS WERE, IN
OUR OPINION, MISLEADING. THE SUBJECTS OF THESE
ADVERTISEMENTS WERE LABOR AND INFLATION, AND
LABOR AND A WEALTH TAX. ONE OF THEM, ON
INFLATION, WAS PUBLISHED IN THE SAME ISSUE OF
THE PAPER.
LATER YESTERDAY, THE LIBERAL PARTY'S
ADVERTISING AGENTS SENT ROUND TWO MORE
ADVERTISEMENTS FOR TODAY'S PAPER, A VARIANT OF
THE INFLATION ADVERTISEMENT, AND AN ADVERTISE-
MENT ABOUT MR HAYDEN AND A WEALTH TAX.
IT IS THE GENERAL PRACTICE OF 'THE AGE', AS
OF MOST OTHER PAPERS, TO PUBLISH ANY ADVERTISE-
MENT PROVIDED THAT IT IS NOT LIBELLOUS OR OTHERWISE
ILLEGAL AND PROVIDED THAT IT WILL NOT OFFEND, ON
GROUNDS OF TASTE, OUR READERS (A SUBJECTIVE
JUDGMENT ON OUR PART, TO BE SURE). WE ARE NOT
IN THE CENSORSHIP BUSINESS.
WHAT ABOUT ADVERTISEMENTS THAT ARE
MISLEADING? ORDINARY COMMERCIAL ADVERTISEMENTS
ARE GOVERNED BY THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT; UNDER
IT, ANY ADVERTISER MAKING FALSE CLAIMS FOR A
PRODUCT CAN BE TAKEN TO COURT. BUT THAT ACT
SCARCELY APPLIES TO THE ELECTION ADVERTISEMENTS
OF POLITICAL PARTIES. THESE COME UNDER THE
COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL ACT 1918, AS AMENDED.
SECTION 161 OF THE ACT READS: "IN ADDITION
TO BRIBERY OR UNDUE INFLUENCE THE FOLLOWING
SHALL BE ILLEGAL PRACTICES: - (E) PRINTING,
PUBLISHING, OR DISTRIBUTING ANY ELECTORAL
ADVERTISEMENT, NOTICE, HANDBILL, PAMPHLET, OR
CARD CONTAINING ANY UNTRUE OR INCORRECT
STATEMENT INTENDED OR LIKELY TO MISLEAD OR
IMPROPERLY INTERFERE WITH ANY ELECTOR IN OR IN
RELATION TO THE CASTING OF HIS VOTE".
THE FIRST QUESTION TO BE RESOLVED, THEREFORE,
WAS WHETHER EITHER OF THE ADVERTISEMENTS
SUBMITTED BREACHED THE ACT (A BREACH IS
PUNISHABLE BY A FINE NOT EXCEEDING $200 OR BY
IMPRISONMENT NOT EXCEEDING SIX MONTHS). WE
SOUGHT LEGAL ADVICE. THE INFLATION ADVERTISEMENT,
WE DECIDED, DID NOT BREACH THE ACT. BUT THE
SECOND ONE, ABOUT MR HAYDEN AND THE WEALTH
TAX, DID. THE HEADLINE READ: "MR HAYDEN 'WON'T
RETREAT' FROM LABOR'S 'WEALTH' TAXES THAT
THREATEN THE UNWEALTHY".
THIS SENTENCE CARRIES THE CLEAR IMPLICATION,
IMPARTED BY THE QUOTATION MARKS ROUND THE
WORDS 'WON'T RETREAT', THAT MR HAYDEN HIMSELF
IS SAYING AT PRESENT THAT HE WON'T RETREAT FROM
LABOR'S 'WEALTH' TAXES. THIS IS NOT TRUE. ACCORD-
INGLY 'THE AGE' ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT
TELEPHONED THE ADVERTISING AGENTS AND ADVISED
THEM THAT WE WOULD NOT PUBLISH THE ADVERTISE-
MENT IN THAT FORM. REMOVAL OF THE QUOTATION
MARKS WOULD REMOVE THE IMPLICATION THAT MR
HAYDEN HIMSELF WAS SAYING THAT HE STUCK TO A
NO-RETREAT POLICY, AND MAKE IT PLAIN THAT THE
SENTENCE WAS A STATEMENT OF OPINION ABOUT MR
HAYDEN, NOT A QUOTE BY HIM.
A TRIVIAL CHANGE, SOME MIGHT SAY. HOWEVER,
IT IS BY SUCH SMALL VERBAL CHANGES THAT LAWYERS
MAKE A LIVING, AND TERMS OF IMPRISONMENT ARE,
WE HOPE, AVOIDED. THE EARLIER PHRASING WAS A
BREACH OF THE ACT, IN OUR OPINION, WHEREAS THE
AMENDED PHRASING IS NOT.
BUT SHOULD WE HAVE REFUSED TO PUBLISH BOTH
ADVERTISEMENTS, QUITE APART FROM THEIR LEGALITY,
BECAUSE IN OUR OPINION THEY ARE MISLEADING?
UNLESS WE ARE TO SET OURSELVES UP AS CENSORS IN
OUR OWN RIGHT OF POLITICAL ELECTIONEERING
METHODS, WE CAN ONLY GO BY THE LAW AS LAID
DOWN IN THE PERTINENT ACTS OF PARLIAMENT. AS
THE LAW STANDS, POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE A RIGHT TO
TRY TO MISLEAD VOTERS; THAT IS, AFTER ALL, A FACT
OF POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING, HOWEVER DEPLORABLE.
ALL PARTIES DO IT. THE LIBERAL PARTY HAS PAID
FOR THE SPACE. IT IS THE LIBERAL PARTY THAT IS
SAYING THAT THE LABOR PARTY'S POLICIES WILL
PRODUCE 20 PER CENT INFLATION AND THAT MR
HAYDEN WON'T RETREAT FROM WEALTH TAXES. AND
WE ARE SAYING THAT THEY'VE PLUCKED THE 20 PER
CENT FIGURE OUT OF THIN AIR AND THAT MR HAYDEN
HAS IN FACT RECENTLY RETREATED ON A WEALTH TAX
AND ON A CAPITAL GAINS TAX.
THIS MINOR EPISODE RAISES AGAIN THE QUESTION
OF GOVERNMENT FUNDING OF ELECTIONS, SO THAT THE
ABILITY TO BUY ADVERTISING SPACE AND TIME PLAYS
A SMALLER PART IN ELECTIONS THAN BOTH PARTIES
SEEM TO THINK IT DOES AS THINGS STAND. IT
ALSO POSES THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
WE NEED SOME FORM OF ELECTORIAL FAIR PLAY
COMMISSION, ITS COMPOSITION AGREED BY ALL SIDES,
WHICH VETS POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE MASS
MEDIA BEFORE THEY ARE PRINTED OR BROADCAST. IT
SEEMS QUITE WRONG THAT, AS IN THE PRESENT
INSTANCE, IT SHOULD BE LEFT TO INDIVIDUAL
NEWSPAPERS TO DECIDE WHAT THE POLITICIANS MAY
OR MAY NOT SAY TO THE VOTERS. IT IS THE JOB OF A
NEWSPAPER, NOT TO SUPPRESS POLITICIANS' LIES,
BUT TO PRINT THEM AND TELL THE READERS THAT THEY
ARE INDEED LIES.

THURSDAY 16 OCTOBER 1980
"THE HAYDEN ALTERNATIVE"
YESTERDAY, WE DISCUSSED MR FRASER'S
ECONOMIC POLICIES. TODAY WE TACKLE MR
HAYDEN'S. HIS ECONOMIC WORLD IS CERTAINLY
INVITING. THERE IS COMPASSION THERE, AND HOPE AND
SOCIAL JUSTICE - AND CHEAP PETROL. AWKWARD
PROBLEMS SUCH AS OPEC AND CHEAP IMPORTS AND
OVER-POWERFUL UNIONS HAVE PLAYED LITTLE PART IN
LABOR'S ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
BUT INTO THIS OPTIMISM WE MUST INJECT
REALISM, AND IT IS PARTICULARLY NEEDED IN MR
HAYDEN'S ECONOMIC POLICIES. AS FAR AS WE CAN
DETERMINE FROM THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE ASKED
THE OPPOSITION, FROM THOSE WE HAVE ASKED MR
HAYDEN PERSONALLY, AND FROM THOSE HE WAS
ASKED AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB YESTERDAY, A
LABOR GOVERNMENT WOULD REGARD THE PROBLEM
OF INFLATION AS RELATIVELY EASY TO HANDLE. INDEED,
IT SOMETIMES SOUNDS AS IF THE LABOR PARTY
BELIEVES THAT INFLATION WILL FIX ITSELF, IF ONLY WE
CAN GET PETROL PRICES AND HEALTH COSTS DOWN.
THERE ARE TWO MISSING LINKS IN LABOR'S
ECONOMIC STRATEGY. FIRST, THE LABOR PARTY SAYS
THAT IF YOU GIVE WORKERS SOMETHING, UNIONS
WON'T ASK FOR MORE, OR AT LEAST FOR MUCH MORE.
IS THIS SO? WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE THAT MR
HAYDEN CAN ACHIEVE AGREEMENT FROM THE UNION
MOVEMENT TO MODERATE WAGE DEMANDS? THE
LABOR PARTY'S ANSWER TO THIS BOILS DOWN,
BASICALLY, TO THE TWIN CLAIMS THAT IT HAS A SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNION MOVEMENT, AND MR
BOB HAWKE TO PURSUE IT. BUT A LABOR
GOVERNMENT - EVEN IF YOU GIVE IT FULL WEIGHT FOR
THESE ADVANTAGES - WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY AND
ON ITS OWN ADMISSION BE PURSUING A COURSE IN
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT THAT TENDED TO WORK
AGAINST WAGE RESTRAINT. THAT POLICY IS ECONOMIC
EXPANSION, ACHIEVED BY ALLOWING THE MONEY
SUPPLY AND THE GOVERNMENT DEFICIT TO RUN AHEAD
OF WHAT A FRASER GOVERNMENT WOULD ALLOW.
THE LABOR PARTY ARGUES THAT THE EXTRA
CASH INJECTED INTO THE ECONOMY WOULD BE
RELATIVELY MINOR IN AN ECONOMY WITH A GROSS
DOMESTIC PRODUCT OF $125 BILLION. BUT A HIGHER
LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN THE ECONOMY WOULD PUT
PRESSURE BEHIND WAGE INCREASES AND A MORE
PERMISSIVE MONETARY POLICY WOULD WEAKEN THE
OPPOSITION OF FIRMS TO GRANTING THEM. IN THE
FACE OF TRENDS LIKE THIS - THE INTENDED RESULT OF
LABOR'S ECONOMIC POLICY - ANY ARRANGEMENT
WITH THE UNIONS WOULD SURELY BE A FRAGILE REED.
THE SECOND WEAKNESS IN LABOR'S ECONOMIC
POLICY IS ITS BUDGET ACCOUNTING. MR HAYDEN WILL
FIND IT HARD TO GET THE MONEY HE WANTS FROM
TAX AVOIDERS; IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME FOR THE
MONEY TO COME IN FROM A RESOURCES TAX; YET HE
IS PROPOSING TO SPEND HEAVILY BY COMPARISON
WITH THE FRASER GOVERNMENT.
TO THESE DOUBTS ABOUT LABOR'S ECONOMIC
STRATEGY, WE MUST ADD A THIRD. WE ARE BOUND
TO SAY WE WONDER ABOUT MR HAYDEN'S ATTITUDE
TO INFLATION. IN 'THE AGE' YESTERDAY, MR HAYDEN
WAS ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT INFLATION, AND HE
GAVE AN UNSATISFACTORY REPLY. HE SAID THAT HIS
MORE EXPANSIONARY ECONOMIC POLICIES DID NOT
RISK HIGHER INFLATION. WHY? BECAUSE HEALTH AND
PETROL PRICES WOULD COME DOWN; BECAUSE A
HIGHER LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WOULD ALLOW
FIXED OVERHEADS TO BE SPREAD ACROSS BIGGER
OUTPUT; AND BECAUSE HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD
SECURE WAGE RESTRAINT. THIS IS OPTIMISTIC
ECONOMICS, GIVEN THAT A HAYDEN GOVERNMENT
WOULD ALLOW THE MONEY SUPPLY TO RISE IN LINE
WITH GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY, THEREBY FORGOING
THE RESTRAINT IMPOSED BY THE FRASER GOVERNMENT.
A GOVERNMENT FINDS IT HARD TO ACQUIRE
FINANCIAL PRUDENCE ONCE IT WINS OFFICE. THE
TEMPTATIONS ARE ON THE SIDE OF SPENDING A LITTLE
MORE AND TAXING A LITTLE LESS. A PARTY THAT GOES
INTO AN ELECTION WITH A QUESTIONABLE ATTITUDE
TO INFLATION AND A SHAKY PLAN FOR BEATING IT IS,
AT THE LEAST, A RISK. AS FOR INFLATION, SO FOR PETROL
PRICES. NO ONE CAN DOUBT THAT THE RISE IN PETROL
PRICES HAS CAUSED HARDSHIP IN THE AUSTRALIAN
COMMUNITY, JUST AS IT HAS CAUSED HARDSHIP IN
OTHER COUNTRIES. MR HAYDEN IS SEEKING TO WIN
VOTES BY PROMISING CHEAPER PETROL. BUT THAT
PROMISE WILL NOT BE EASY TO KEEP. LET US HOPE
THAT A HAYDEN GOVERNMENT WOULD BE AS TOUGH
WITH ITS RESOURCES TAX AS IT IS LENIENT WITH THE
CRUDE-OIL PRICE.
WHERE MR HAYDEN'S ECONOMIC ATTITUDES
SCORE OVER MR FRASER'S IS ON UNEMPLOYMENT.
WHEN THE POSTMORTEMS ON THIS ELECTION ARE
PERFORMED BY THE POLITICAL SCIENTISTS, IT WILL
PROBABLY TURN OUT THAT UNEMPLOYMENT WAS A
KEY ISSUE. MR FRASER HAS, BY AND LARGE, PROMISED
MORE OF THE SAME FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.
MR HAYDEN AT LEAST OFFERS SOME PALLIATIVES: A
SUBSIDY TO PRIVATE EMPLOYERS AND JOB-CREATION
SCHEMES. THESE ARE SHORT-TERM MEASURES BUT
- GIVEN THE SOCIAL DAMAGE BEING DONE BY
UNEMPLOYMENT - BETTER THAN NOTHING. ON
AVERAGE, PEOPLE NOW HAVE TO WAIT 30 WEEKS
BEFORE THEY CAN FIND A JOB. MR HAYDEN ARGUES
PERSUASIVELY THAT THE MORE EXPANSIONARY
ECONOMIC POLICIES HE PROPOSES WOULD THEMSELVES
STIMULATE GROWTH AND HENCE EMPLOYMENT IN THE
PRIVATE SECTOR. THE DANGER, AND IT IS A REAL
DANGER, IS THAT THOSE JOBS WOULD BE BOUGHT AT
THE COST OF HIGHER INFLATION.
LABOR APPEARS SUCCESSFULLY TO HAVE BASED
ITS CAMPAIGN ON THE BELIEF - SUPPORTED BY THE
POLLS - THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY
THINK THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING IS DECLINING. MR
HAYDEN HAS GONE FOR THE HIP POCKET NERVE. IT IS
STILL NOT CLEAR THAT THE MONEY CAN BE FOUND TO
MEET HIS PROMISES WITHOUT SERIOUS ECONOMIC
RISKS. 'THE AGE' CANNOT BE ACCUSED OF BEING
KIND TO MR FRASER AND HIS RECORD AND PROPOSALS
YESTERDAY. WE EXTEND A SIMILARLY SCEPTICAL
RESPONSE TO MR HAYDEN'S POLICIES.
"RECOGNISING POL POT'S EVIL"
ONE OF THE SORRIEST EPISODES IN AUSTRALIAN
DIPLOMACY IS NOT YET OVER. THE FOREIGN
MINISTER, MR PEACOCK, HAS ANNOUNCED THE
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION "IN EFFECT" TO DERECOGNISE
THE POL POT REGIME IN KAMPUCHEA. BUT
RECOGNITION IS TO CONTINUE "DURING A LIMITED TIME
FRAME". THE PRIME MINISTER AND MR PEACOCK
DESCRIBE THE POL POT REGIME AS LOATHSOME -
AND WHO COULD DISAGREE WITH THEM? THE
MILLIONS OF DEAD AND THE SCARRED LIVING ARE
TESTIMONY TO MISMANAGEMENT, FANATICISM AND
GENOCIDAL BRUTALITY. NEVERTHELESS, FOR THE TIME
BEING. AUSTRALIA NOT ONLY PAYS THE REGIME A
DIPLOMATIC RESPECT IT DOES NOT DESERVE - THE
KHMER ROUGE DO NOT CONTROL THE COUNTRY AND
ARE IN NO SENSE A GOVERNMENT - BUT ALSO VOTES
IN THE UNITED NATIONS IN FAVOR OF THE POL
POT DELEGATION AS OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF
KAMPUCHEA. THE POLICY DEFIES LOGIC AND
MORALITY.
MR FRASER CLAIMS THAT THE POLICY IS IN THE
INTERESTS OF THE KAMPUCHEAN PEOPLE AND THE
ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH-EAST ASIAN NATIONS. THE
ARGUMENT IS THAT DERECOGNITION OF POL POT WOULD
BE IMPLICIT RECOGNITION OF THE VIETNAM-BACKED
HENG SAMRIN REGIME AND WOULD GIVE AN
IMPRIMATUR TO VIETNAMESE AGGRESSION. THIS
SIMPLY DOES NOT STAND EXAMINATION. THERE IS A
TRIED AND RESPECTED FORMULA FOR WITHDRAWING
RECOGNITION FROM POL POT WHILE AT THE SAME
TIME EXPLICITLY WITHHOLDING RECOGNITION FROM
HENG SAMRIN - AND CALLING FOR THE WITHDRAWAL
OF VIETNAMESE TROOPS. MR PEACOCK HAS PROPERLY
BEEN SUGGESTING THIS FORMULA FOR SOME TIME.
MR FRASER'S STAND SEEMS BASED MORE ON HIS
CONCERN ABOUT SOVIET EXPANSIONISM THAN ON
AWARENESS OF THE REALITIES OF KAMPUCHEA AND THE
REGION. HE IGNORES POL POT'S PROVOCATION OF
VIETNAM. HE IGNORES THE FACT THAT WHILE THE
KAMPUCHEANS WANT TO BE FREE OF THE VIETNAMESE,
THEY PREFER THE HENG SAMRIN REGIME TO THE
BARBARITY OF POL POT.
CONTINUED RECOGNITION OF POL POT IS AN
INSULT TO THE PEOPLE OF KAMPUCHEA - AND ONLY
GIVES THE VIETNAMESE REASON FOR STAYING IN
KAMPUCHEA. JUST AS COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE IS
AUSTRALIA'S DENIAL OF AID TO VIETNAM. IT SIMPLY
FORCES VIETNAM INTO THE ARMS OF THE SOVIET
UNION, THE VERY THING MR FRASER WANTS TO
PREVENT. THE UN CREDENTIALS VOTE HAS COME JUST
BEFORE THE AUSTRALIAN ELECTIONS AND SO THE
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A DECLARATION
OF INTENT AS IF SOMETHING HAS CHANGED. NOTHING
HAS, EXCEPT THE UGLY POL POT FICTION IS PERPETUATED
IN THE UN (SURELY THE SEAT COULD HAVE BEEN LEFT
VACANT?). RECOGNITION OF THE POL POT REGIME WAS
WRONG, ONCE ITS EVILS WERE REVEALED AND ITS
POWER BROKEN. IT IS WRONG NOW AND WILL CONTINUE
TO BE WRONG. IT SHOULD BE ENDED IMMEDIATELY.
<F23>
FRIDAY 17 OCTOBER 1980
"WAITING FOR SATURDAY"
THERE IS A STRANGE MOOD ABROAD IN AUSTRALIA,
AS THE ELECTRONIC BABBLE OF THE PAST THREE
WEEKS SUDDENLY STOPS AND EVERYONE WAITS FOR
SATURDAY EVENING AND THE FIRST RESULTS OF THE
ELECTION. MR FRASER AND HIS ENTOURAGE ARE SAID
TO BE CONFIDENT, ALTHOUGH WE DOUBT WHETHER THEY
ARE AS ASSURED AS THEY SOUND. MR HAYDEN IS
APPARENTLY ALREADY PLANNING WHAT HE WILL DO
WHEN HE IS ELECTED; HE IS GOING TO STAY AT HIS
HOME BASE OF IPSWICH IN QUEENSLAND,
CONSPICUOUSLY INACTIVE, CAREFULLY PREPARING NOT
TO BEHAVE LIKE MR WHITLAM IN 1972, WITH THE
AIM OF CONVEYING TO THE NATION THAT ELECTED HIM
AN APPEARANCE OF ASSURANCE AND CALM. MEANWHILE,
IN CANBERRA THE CIVIL SERVANTS WONDER WHAT IS
IN STORE FOR THEM, AND PREPARE FOR NEW MINISTERS,
AND REFLECT GRATEFULLY THAT, WHATEVER HAPPENS,
THEIR SALARIES ARE BOTH GENEROUS AND INTACT.
THERE IS A FEELING OF CHANGE IN THE OFFING,
YET NOBODY, EXCEPT MR HAYDEN, SEEMS QUITE TO
BELIEVE IT. WE ARE ALL IN THRALL TO THE POLLS; WE
HAVE LITTLE CHOICE, GIVEN THEIR RECORD OF ACCURATE
PREDICTIONS OVER THE PAST DECADE AND MORE. YET
NOBODY QUITE BELIEVES IN THEIR TABLES AND PRECISE
PERCENTAGE POINTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY INDICATE
THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING OUT THERE AMONG THE
VOTERS THAT TOTALLY ESCAPED EVERYONE'S INDIVIDUAL
NOTICE UNTIL THE POLLS STARTED SAYING THAT OPINION
WAS ON THE MOVE.
SO THE MOOD IS EXPECTANT AND UNCERTAIN, WITH
ONLY THE ZEALOTS ON BOTH SIDES CONVINCED THAT
THEY KNOW THE ANSWER ALREADY. AND THIS IS AS IT
SHOULD BE. THERE ARE STILL, EVEN AT THIS LATE HOUR,
A LOT OF "DON'T KNOWS" OUT THERE. IT WILL BE A
SAD DAY WHEN WE ALL ASSUME, WITHOUT QUESTION,
THAT THE POLLS ARE ABSOLUTELY RELIABLE PROPHETS
OF ELECTION RESULTS.
"BRITISH LABOR PARTY IN CHAOS"
AT A TIME WHEN SUPPORT FOR BRITAIN'S
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT IS IN SERIOUS
DECLINE, THE LABOR PARTY APPEARS TO BE TEARING
ITSELF TO PIECES. ITS CREDIBILITY AS AN ALTERNATIVE
GOVERNMENT MUST BE IN DOUBT THIS WEEK AFTER
THE EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS AT THE PARTY CONFERENCE
IN BLACKPOOL AND THE RESIGNATION OF MR JAMES
CALLAGHAN AS PARTY LEADER. MR CALLAGHAN'S
ANNOUNCEMENT ON WEDNESDAY, AFTER A MEETING
OF THE SHADOW CABINET, SMACKS OF THE DESPAIR
OF A LEADER WHO WENT A DOZEN ROUNDS WITH THE
LEFT AT THE WINTER GARDENS AND LOST ALL BUT
ONE. PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO LOSE
THEM ALL. FOR THE RIGHT'S SINGLE VICTORY - THE
RIGHT OF THE LEADER TO CHAIR THE GROUP WHICH
WRITES ELECTION MANIFESTOES - SITS UN-
COMFORTABLY WITH THE RANGE OF POLICIES TO WHICH
THE PARTY HAS NOW COMMITTED ITSELF.
IT HAS DECIDED THAT BRITAIN SHOULD WITHDRAW
FROM THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY. IT
HAS COME OUT FOR THE SCRAPPING OF BRITAIN'S
NUCLEAR DEFENCES. IT WANTS TO CREATE A FOREIGN
POLICY BASED ON NEUTRALITY WHILE, CONFUSINGLY,
RETAINING MEMBERSHIP OF NATO. NATIONALISATION
WOULD BE EXTENDED INDEFINITELY, ALTHOUGH THE
TARGETS ARE INDISTINCT. PRIVATE MEDICINE AND
PRIVATE EDUCATION WOULD BE SUPPRESSED. THE
HOUSE OF LORDS WOULD BE ABOLISHED BY PACKING
IT WITH LABOR PEERS PREPARED TO VOTE THE
CHAMBER OUT OF EXISTENCE. AMONG OTHER
DECISIONS TO CAUSE DISQUIET TO THE RIGHT IS THAT
LABOR MPS WILL HAVE TO PRESENT THEMSELVES
FOR RECONSIDERATION BEFORE ALL FUTURE GENERAL
ELECTIONS, A MOVE WHICH MAY PROVIDE
CONSTITUENCY ACTIVISTS, MAINLY LEFT-WINGERS, WITH
INORDINATE INFLUENCE.
MOREOVER, THE LEFT HAS MANAGED TO DITCH
THE SYSTEM OF SELECTING A PARTY LEADER BY A
SIMPLE MAJORITY OF MPS. BUT BECAUSE NO
AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED ON WHAT METHOD
SHOULD REPLACE IT, MR CALLAGHAN'S SUCCESSOR WILL
STILL BE ELECTED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY. THE
RIGHT KNOWS THAT THIS ELECTION, TO BE HELD
WITHIN A MONTH, COULD BE ITS LAST CHANCE TO WIN
THE LEADERSHIP FOR ONE OF ITS OWN BEFORE THE
SELECTION ISSUE COMES BEFORE A SPECIAL PARTY
CONFERENCE EARLY NEXT YEAR. UNTIL THAT TIME,
THEREFORE, WHOEVER SUCCEEDS MR CALLAGHAN WILL
BE TAKING OVER IN THE WORST POSSIBLE CIRCUM-
STANCES. HIS OR HER POSITION MAY BE UNDERMINED
WITHIN DAYS.
THE MAN MOST LIKELY TO LEAD THE PARTY
INTO THE COMMONS NEXT MONTH IS MR
DENIS HEALEY, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE RIGHT AND
THE CENTRE. MR PETER SHORE AND MR JOHN SILKIN
ARE ALREADY UP AGAINST HIM. BUT THE MOST
INTRIGUING AND DIVISIVE POSSIBILITIES - MR TONY
BENN, LEADER OF THE LEFT, AND MR MICHAEL FOOT,
DEPUTY PARTY LEADER AND ALSO OF THE LEFT - ARE
YET TO ANNOUNCE THEIR INTENTIONS. MR BENN WOULD
SEEM UNLIKELY TO WIN UNDER THE PARLIAMENTARY
SYSTEM. BUT IF MR FOOT RUNS AND WINS, HE HAS
MADE CLEAR THAT HE WILL SERVE ONLY UNTIL THE
PROPOSED ELECTORAL COLLEGE HAS BEEN SET UP. AND
IN THAT EVENT, MR BENN COULD LOOK TO THE TRADE
UNION BALLOTS AND THE CONSTITUENCY VOTES IN THE
NEW ELECTORAL SYSTEM TO HAND HIM THE LEADERSHIP.
VICTORY FOR EITHER MR FOOT OR MR BENN
WOULD PLACE THE RIGHTISTS UNDER ALMOST
UNBEARABLE PRESSURE TO QUIT LABOR AND FORM A
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE POLITICAL CENTRE,
POSSIBLY EMBRACING THE LIBERALS. THE RIGHT WILL
NOT GIVE IN EASILY. BUT THE ODDS AGAINST ITS
SUCCESS IN THIS PERIOD OF LICENSED CHAOS ARE
MUCH STEEPER THAN IN THE EARLY 1960S, WHEN
MR GAITSKELL SWUNG THE PARTY BEHIND HIM AND
FORGED A LINK WITH THE UNIONS THAT SURVIVED UNTIL
1980. THE LABOR PARTY TODAY, UNITED ONLY IN
BATTLE FOR WHATEVER IS LEFT OF ITS SOUL, IS A
PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT ORGANISATION. MR CALLAGHAN
MAY GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE LEADER WHO LEFT
HIS PARTY TO MAYHEM, BUT IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD
IF HE GOES WITH SOME SENSE OF PERSONAL RELIEF.
<F24>
SATURDAY 18 OCTOBER 1980
"A CHOICE - NOT A CHALLENGE"
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN
"THE AGE" ANNOUNCED THAT IT DID NOT
PROPOSE TO ADVISE READERS WHICH WAY TO VOTE IN
THIS ELECTION. NOTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE
PAST THREE WEEKS HAS PERSUADED US TO CHANGE
OUR MIND. WHICHEVER SIDE WINS, IT WILL NOT BE
DISASTROUS FOR THIS COUNTRY. IT IS UNLIKELY TO BE
VERY EXCITING EITHER. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A
COALITION GOVERNMENT AND A LABOR GOVERNMENT
WOULD BE DIFFERENCES OF STYLE, EMPHASIS AND
PRIORITY. SOME OF THESE DIFFERENCES ARE
IMPORTANT, BUT NEITHER SIDE IS OFFERING US A
CHANGE IN NATIONAL DIRECTION. INDEED, NEITHER
HAS PRODUCED EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT IT IS
THINKING FAR AHEAD AT ALL. IT HAS BEEN A SHORT
CAMPAIGN - PERHAPS TOO SHORT - CONCENTRATED
ON SHORT-TERM QUESTIONS.
IT COMES DOWN TO THIS:THE COALITION SAYS IT
WOULD CONTINUE TO MAKE THE BATTLE AGAINST
INFLATION ITS FIRST PRIORITY, WHILE LABOR OFFERS
SOME IMMEDIATE ACTION TO CREATE JOBS AND
IMPROVE LIVING STANDARDS. THE COALITION ARGUES,
AS IT HAS ARGUED CONSISTENTLY FOR FIVE YEARS, THAT
ONLY IF INFLATION IS KEPT UNDER TIGHT CONTROL CAN
WE HOPE FOR A SUSTAINABLE DECLINE IN
UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE GENERATION OF LONG-TERM
ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH INVESTMENT IN THE
PRIVATE SECTOR. IT SAYS ARTIFICIAL JOB-CREATION
SCHEMES FUNDED THROUGH GOVERNMENT MONEY
ARE A SNARE AND A DELUSION, THAT LABOR'S
PROMISES OF MODEST INCOME TAX CUTS AND
INCREASED SPENDING WOULD FUEL RUNAWAY
INFLATION, AND THAT LABOR'S OFFER TO FREEZE CRUDE
OIL PRICES WOULD ENCOURAGE IRRESPONSIBLE
CONSUMPTION OF A SCARCE AND DWINDLING
AUSTRALIAN RESOURCE.
ON THE OTHER SIDE, LABOR SAYS ITS JOB
CREATION SCHEMES ARE A NECESSARY SHORT-TERM
MEASURE AIMED AT IMMEDIATE RELIEF OF A GRAVE
SOCIAL PROBLEM AND THAT ITS PLANS TO INCREASE
THE SPENDING POWER OF INDIVIDUALS WILL
ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC GROWTH, THEREBY CREATING
PERMANENT JOBS AND PRODUCING MORE REVENUE
THAT WOULD ENABLE A LABOR GOVERNMENT TO FULFIL
ITS PROGRAMME WITHOUT BOOSTING INFLATION.
LABOR MAINTAINS THAT ITS PROPOSED RESOURCES
RENTAL TAX IS THE ONLY WAY OF ENSURING THAT THE
AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE GET A FAIR SHARE OF THE PROFITS
FROM THE RESOURCES BOOM; THE COALITION SAYS
SUCH A TAX WOULD KILL THE BOOM. LABOR SAYS IT
CAN RAISE SOME $600 MILLION BY ABOLISHING TAX
AVOIDANCE; THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT CANNOT BE
DONE. EACH SIDE HAS DEVOTED MUCHENERGY TO
PRODUCING FANCIFUL COSTINGS OF THE OTHER'S
PLEDGES WHILE ITSELF INDULGING IN BLATANT
PORK-BARRELLING: TAKE YOUR PICK BETWEEN CHEAP
AIR TRAVEL FOR TASMANIA AND AN UNNECESSARY
TRAIN LINE FROM ALICE SPRINGS TO DARWIN.
NEITHER SIDE HAS HAD ANYTHING SENSIBLE TO
SAY ABOUT THE LONGER-TERM CHALLENGES FACING THIS
COUNTRY IN THE 'EIGHTIES: THE EFFECT THAT THE
ENORMOUS INFLOW OF CAPITAL NEEDED TO FUND
RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT WOULD HAVE ON OUR
EXCHANGE RATE AND THEREFORE ON OTHER EXPORTING
INDUSTRIES AND IMPORT-COMPETING INDUSTRIES; THE
NEED TO REDUCE PROTECTION OF INEFFICIENT INDUSTRIES
TO ALLOW THE ORDERLY RESTRUCTURING OF THE
MANUFACTURING SECTOR; THE EFFECT SUCH
RESTRUCTURING AND THE ACCELERATING PACE OF
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WILL HAVE ON THE LABOR
MARKET; AND THE ASSOCIATED SOCIAL PROBLEMS
POSED BY STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT.
POLITICAL RHETORIC ASIDE, THIS IS AN ELECTION OF
LIMITED PERSPECTIVES IN WHICH THE TWO SIDES HAVE
TENDED TO EXAGGERATE THEIR DISAGREEMENTS OVER
IMMEDIATE QUESTIONS OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT.
OUR VIEW IS THAT THE ELECTION OF A HAYDEN
GOVERNMENT WOULD POSE GREATER INFLATIONARY
RISKS THAN THE RE-ELECTION OF THE COALITION, BUT
THAT THOSE RISKS WOULD NOT BE ANYTHING LIKE AS
GREAT AS MR FRASER HAS CLAIMED. NOTHING THAT
WE KNOW ABOUT MR HAYDEN'S RECORD, HIS
INCLINATIONS, OR HIS POLICIES FITS WITH THE AWFUL
VISION DRUMMED UP BY LIBERAL PARTY ADVERTISE-
MENTS OF A 20 PER CENT INFLATION MAN. ON THE
OTHER SIDE, MR FRASER IS NOT THE CALLOUSLY
AUSTERE MONETARIST HIS DETRACTORS (AND SOME OF
HIS ADMIRERS) SUGGEST, ALTHOUGH HE IS LESS
ATTUNED TO COMMUNITY CONCERN FOR THE
UNEMPLOYED. THE ARGUMENT BETWEEN THEM OVER
TAXATION HAS LESS TO DO WITH THE TOTAL BURDEN
THAN WITH ITS DISTRIBUTION.
THE EVENTS OF THE CAMPAIGN HAVE, IF
ANYTHING, TENDED TO MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE
NEXT GOVERNMENT, WHATEVER ITS COMPLEXION, WILL
SEEK TO OCCUPY THE CENTRE GROUND. IF THE COALITION
IS RETURNED WITH A HEAVILY REDUCED MAJORITY -
WHICH THE POLLS SUGGEST IS THE BEST IT CAN HOPE
FOR - ITS SUPPORTERS WILL CERTAINLY DEMAND THAT
IT MODERATE ITS POLICIES TO WOO BACK THOSE
SWINGING VOTERS WHO HAVE DESERTED IT. A LABOR
VICTORY WOULD CONFIRM MR HAYDEN IN HIS
CONVICTION THAT THE SECRET OF ELECTORAL SUCCESS
IS TO WIN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE SUBURBAN
MIDDLE CLASS. IF EITHER FORGETS THE LESSONS OF THE
CAMPAIGN, IT SEEMS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT THE
AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE WILL BE IN
A POSITION TO REMIND THEM.
IN THE END, THEN, AUSTRALIA MUST CHOOSE
BETWEEN ACCEPTING LABOR'S MORE GENEROUS
PACKAGE NOW AT A SOMEWHAT INCREASED RISK OF
INFLATION LATER OR PLAYING SAFE AND SETTLING FOR
MR FRASER'S MODEST OFFERING. IT IS NOT AN
EXHILARATING CHOICE BUT, IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD,
THAT MAY NOT BE A BAD THING.
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
IT MIGHT BE EXPECTED THAT BEDTIME ALWAYS
WOULD BE GREETED CHEERFULLY AS NATURE'S
WISE CALL TO REST AND RENEWAL. IT IS THEREFORE
INTERESTING TO REFLECT THAT INDIVIDUALS REACT IN
DIFFERENT WAYS TO THE HOUR TO RETIRE.
AS THE CLOCK INDICATES THE APPROACH OF THE
NIGHTLY DEADLINE, SOME POSTPONE THEIR RESPONSE
AS LONG AS THEY CAN. THE ROUTINE OF TIDYING UP,
UNDRESSING, PERFORMING THEIR ABLUTIONS AND
OTHERWISE PREPARING FOR SLEEP IS A BORING RITUAL
WHICH THEY PERFORM WITH UNABATING RELUCTANCE.
OTHERS REGARD BEDTIME AS AN UNWELCOME
INTERRUPTION TO THEIR HIGHLY PRESSURED ROUND OF
LIVING. IT MAKES NO SENSE, THEY SAY, TO FORFEIT
ONE THIRD OF THEIR LIFETIME TO SLEEP WHEN LIFE IS
SO FULL AND ALL TOO SHORT.
THE ONLY TIME BED IS ATTRACTIVE TO SOME TO
WHOM IT IS OTHERWISE UNINVITING IS WHEN IT LURES
THEM WITH AMOROUS PROSPECTS.
OTHERS ALWAYS GREET THE BLANKETS' CALL AS A
PLEASANT ESCAPE FROM THE DAY'S IMPERIOUS
DEMANDS. THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF SUCH A DEVOTEE
OF BED IS SAMUEL PEPYS, WHO DID EVERYTHING
WITH GUSTO. HE REPEATEDLY WRITES OF BEDTIME WITH
THE SAME ALACRITY AS HE MIGHT SPEAK OF A PARTY,
AS, "WITH MUCH CONTENT TO BED WITH MIGHTY REST
ALL NIGHT". AND OF THE NEXT NIGHT: "SO TO SUPPER
AND BED WITH MY MIND AT MIGHTY EASE".
THOSE FOR WHOM BEDTIME IS HAUNTED BY
AN ANTICIPATION OF TOSSING AND TURNING WHILE
VAINLY WOOING THE ARMS OF MORPHEUS, MIGHT
WELL ENVY PEPYS'S "MIGHTY CONTENTMENT". BUT
THE FAMOUS DIARIST SEEMS NEVER TO HAVE ALLOWED
THE TROUBLES OF HIS DAYS TO INTRUDE INTO THE
SERENITY OF HIS NIGHTS.
SLEEP COMES MORE WILLINGLY TO THOSE WHO
CAN CALL A DAY A DAY. YET MANY A BUSINESSMAN
TAKES HIS OFFICE DESK TO BED WITH HIM, THERE TO
COGITATE UPON ITS CONTENTS, HIS STAFF PROBLEMS,
HIS PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT, HIS INCOME TAX
RETURN. WHILE MANY A WOMAN LIES AWAKE IN THE
DARK, HER MIND PERAMBULATES BETWEEN THE
SUPERMARKET SHELVES, REPLAYS HER DISASTROUS
GAME OF GOLF OR KEEPS ON REVISING HER GUEST LIST.
OTHERS FIND WAYS TO ENSURE THAT "THE CARES
THAT INFEST THE DAY" ARE BARRED FROM BED. LORD
BURGHLEY, MINISTER OF ELIZABETH I, WOULD HANG
UP HIS ROBES OF OFFICE AT BEDTIME, SAYING, "STAY
THERE TILL MORNING, LORD CHANCELLOR", THEN, AS
PLAIN WILLIAM CECIL, PASS INTO UNTROUBLED REST,
MRS MARGARET THATCHER HAS REVEALED THAT BEFORE
RETIRING AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK SHE READS A GOOD
SPY THRILLER, AS SHE SAYS, "TO EMPTY ONE'S MIND
LATE AT NIGHT".
SOME KEEP A NOTE PAD BESIDE THE BED ON
WHICH TO JOT DOWN WORRYING THOUGHTS AT BEDTIME,
SO EXTERIORISING THEM AND FREEING THEIR MINDS TO
CONCENTRATE ON RESTFUL, RELAXING THOUGHTS THAT
INDUCE SLEEP.
IT IS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT THROUGHOUT HISTORY
PEOPLE HAVE SPENT THEIR LAST WAKING MINUTES IN
PRAYER. WHATEVER OTHER VALUE SUCH A PRACTICE
MAY HAVE, THOSE WHO OBSERVE IT SPEAK OF ITS
SOOTHING EFFECT AS A PRELUDE TO A NIGHT OF
PEACEFUL REST.
<F25>
MONDAY 20 OCTOBER 1980
"SO IT'S FRASER, AFTER ALL"
THE LIBERAL-NCP GOVERNMENT LED BY MR
MALCOLM FRASER HAS BEEN RETURNED TO
POWER FOR A THIRD TERM IN AN ELECTION FULL OF
SUSPENSE AND SURPRISES. WE CONGRATULATE HIM
ON HIS VICTORY, AND MR BILL HAYDEN ON A
COMMENDABLE EFFORT. AT THE CLOSEOF COUNT ON
SATURDAY NIGHT, IT APPEARED THAT A NARROW
MAJORITY OF AUSTRALIANS VOTED DIRECTLY OR
PREFERENTIALLY FOR THE LABOR ALTERNATIVE, BUT THAT
THE COALITION WOULD WIN A COMFORTABLE MAJORITY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THIS WOULD
HAVE BEEN LARGELY A REFLECTION OF AN ELECTORAL
SYSTEM IN WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION
AND ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES HAS A SLIGHT BUT
SUFFICIENTLY SIGNIFICANT BUILT-IN BIAS TOWARDS THE
CONSERVATIVE PARTIES. BUT FURTHER FIGURES SHOWED
THE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION EACH TO HAVE
WON AN EQUAL PROPORTION OF THE NATIONAL VOTE.
THE SWING TO LABOR - ABOUT 4 PER CENT IN TWO-
PARTY PREFERRED TERMS - WAS NOT ENOUGH TO
DEFEAT THE COALITION. MOREOVER, THE 6.2 PER CENT
ADVANCE IN LABOR'S PRIMARY VOTE WAS FAR FROM
UNIFORM, AND THE UNUSUALLY WIDE VARIATIONS
FROM STATE TO STATE AND SEAT TO SEAT DID NOT
NEATLY CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT. LABOR POLLED BEST
IN MANY SEATS WHERE IT DID NOT NEED EXTRA VOTES,
AND SITTING GOVERNMENT MEMBERS CLUNG ON IN
MANY SEATS WHICH LABOR HAD EXPECTED TO WIN
EASILY.
HENCE THE APPARENT DISCREPANCY BETWEEN
PREDICTIONS BASED ON OPINION POLLS AND THE
OUTCOME IN TERMS OF SEATS. NEVER BEFORE HAS
AN AUSTRALIAN ELECTION BEEN SO INFLUENCED -
AND CONFUSED - BY THE OPINION POLLS. THE
GOVERNMENT ENTERED THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN
CONFIDENT THAT IT WOULD REMAIN IN OFFICE, AN
EXPECTATION SHARED BY MOST VOTERS. THEN THE
OPINION POLLS SUGGESTED, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER
THE LEADERS' POLICY SPEECHES, THAT LABOR WOULD
WIN, OR THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HOLD ON BY
ONLY THE BAREST MAJORITY. THE LIBERAL PARTY,
PARTICULARLY, MODIFIED ITS CAMPAIGN ACCORDINGLY,
UNDERPLAYING THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PRIME
MINISTER, WHO WAS PERCEIVED TO BE RELATIVELY
UNPOPULAR, AND AROUSING ANXIETIES IN THEIR
ADVERTISING, LESS THAN HONESLTLY, ABOUT THE
CONSEQUENCES OF A LABOR VICTORY. THIS SWITCH IN
TACTICS MAY WELL HAVE INFLUENCED SOME VOTERS
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS.
PERHAPS THE MOST REMARKABLE FEATURE OF THE
ELECTION WAS THE WIDE VARIATION IN THE SWING TO
LABOR FROM STATE TO STATE. LABOR FARED BEST IN
THE TRADITIONALLY CONSERVATIVE STATES OF VICTORIA,
QUEENSLAND AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AND WORST
IN THE THREE STATES WHERE IT COULD HAVE BEEN
EXPECTED TO POLL WELL: NEW SOUTH WALES, SOUTH
AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIA. THE ABRASIVE STYLE OF
THE COURT GOVERNMENT IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND
THE COALITION DISHARMONY IN QUEENSLAND, PLUS
THE PREVAILING SUSPICION OF CANBERRA IN THESE
TWO "FRONTIER" STATES, MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO
LABOR GAINS THERE. BUT THE LOSS OF GOVERNMENT
SUPPORT IN VICTORIA (OR FAILURE TO PICK UP THE
DECLINE IN DLP AND DEMOCRATS' VOTES),AND THE
LOSS OF SOME SEATS WITH SWINGS OF 6 TO 8 PER
CENT, MUST WORRY THE COALITION PARTIES. LABOR,
IN TURN, MUST BE CONCERNED BY ITS FAILURE TO
INSPIRE AN IMPRESSIVE INCREASE IN SUPPORT IN
SYDNEY AND ADELAIDE. LABOR STALWARTS MAY BE
TEMPTED TO BLAME THIS PARTLY ON THE HOSTILE
ATTITUDE OF MR RUPERT MURDOCH'S NEWSPAPERS IN
THESE CITIES. A MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION MAY BE
THAT THIS TIME LABOR GAINED VOTES IN THOSE STATES
WHERE IT MADE LITTLE OR NO HEADWAY IN 1977.
ONE IRONY OF THE RESULTS IS THAT THE TWO
MINOR PARTIES WHOSE POPULAR SUPPORT FELL
SIGNIFICANTLY WILL HAVE THEIR PARLIAMENTARY
INFLUENCE ENHANCED. THE NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY
LOST PROPORTIONATELY MORE VOTES THAN THE
LIBERALS, BUT WILL BE IN A STRONGER POSITION IN
THE COALITION, BECAUSE ALL BUT POSSIBLY ONE OF THE
SEATS LOST BY THE GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN HELD BY
LIBERALS. THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS' SHARE OF
THE VOTE FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WAS
ALSO TRIMMED BACK - MOST OF IT APPARENTLY
GOING TO LABOR - BUT THE PARTY MAY HOLD THE
BALANCE OF POWER IN THE SENATE WITH THE
TASMANIAN INDEPENDENT SENATOR HARRADINE FROM
1 JULY. THIS COULD MAKE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT AND
UNPREDICTABLE FOR THE FRASER GOVERNMENT,
ALTHOUGH SENATOR CHIPP HAS PROMISED TO BE
"RESPONSIBLE, NOT OBSTRUCTIONIST".
ALL THIS SAID, MR FRASER IS ENTITLED TO FEEL
THOROUGHLY SATISFIED WITH THE ELECTION OUTCOME.
ONCE AGAIN, HIS POLITICAL INSTINCTS HAVE BEEN
VINDICATED BY, AS HE LIKES TO PUT IT, THE ONLY
POLL THAT COUNTS. HE TOOK THE RISK OF FIGHTING
HIS CAMPAIGN ESSENTIALLY ON HIS RECORD AND
ECONOMIC STRATEGY. IN SPITE OF SOME DUBIOUS
CONCESSIONS DIRECTED TO SELECTED INTEREST GROUPS,
THE PRIME MINISTER REFUSED TO DILUTE HIS STERN
DOCTRINE OF ECONOMIC RESTRAINT OR TO ENGAGE IN
AN EXPANSIVE (AND EXPENSIVE) VOTE-BUYING SPREE.
AFTER HIS SINGULAR ELECTORAL SUCCESSES IN 1975
AND 1977, SOME LOSS OF POPULAR SUPPORT AND
REDUCTION OF HIS 49-SEAT MAJORITY WAS TO BE
EXPECTED. MR FRASER'S STATURE AND AUTHORITY
WITHIN HIS PARTY AND THE COALITION HAS  BEEN
FORMIDABLY REINFORCED, AND THE GOVERNMENT'S
SMALLER MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OFREPRESENTATIVES
AND VULNERABILITY IN THE SENATE COULD WELL
HAVE THE EFFECT OF TIGHTENING PARTY DISCIPLINE.
MR HAYDEN AND THE LABOR PARTY MUST BE
DISAPPOINTED THAT THE EXPECTATIONS RAISED BY
THE OPINION POLLS WERE NOT CONFIRMED BY THE
ELECTION RESULTS. BUT HALVING THE GOVERNMENT'S
MAJORITY OF SEATS AND IMPROVING ITS SHARE OF
THE NATIONAL VOTE BY 6.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS IS
A CREDITABLE PERFORMANCE. ALTHOUGH IT HAD MUCH
LESS MONEY TO SPEND THN ITS OPPONENTS, THE
LABOR PARTY WAGED A SKILFUL CAMPAIGN,
PROJECTING AN IMAGE OF UNITY, MODERATION AND
RESPONSIBILITY, AND CONCENTRATING ON LIVING
STANDARDS AND FAMILY WELFARE. LABOR HAS
LARGELY NEUTRALISED NEGATIVE MEMORIES OF THE
WHITLAM YEARS BUT NOT ENTIRELY QUELLED FEARS
THAT A HAYDEN ADMINISTRATION WOULD MEAN A
RISK OF HIGHER INFLATION AND TAXATION. SOME
OBSERVERS SEE A PARALLEL BETWEEN THE LATEST
ELECTION AND THAT OF 1969, WHEN LABOR LAID A
FIRM FOUNDATION FOR ITS TRIUMPH OF 1972. THREE
YEARS IS A LONG TIME IN POLITICS, BUT LABOR WILL
NOT HAVE TO SCALE SO HIGH TO WIN POWER IN 1983
AS IT DID THIS TIME. MR HAYDEN PERFORMED MUCH
BETTER THAN EVEN MANY OF HIS OWNSUPPORTERS
HAD EXPECTED AND HAS AMPLY CONFIRMED HIS
LEADERSHIP OF THE LABOR PARTY. MR BOB HAWKE,
HOWEVER, FACES A FAIRLY DREARY THREE YEARS ON
THE OPPOSITION FRONT BENCH WITH NO EARLY
PROSPECT OF ATTAINING HIS AMBITION OF BECOMING
A LABOR PRIME MINISTER.
FOR THEIR PART, MR FRASER AND HIS
GOVERNMENT, ELATED THOUGH THEY ARE ENTITLED
TO BE BY THE ELECTION VERDICT, CANNOT AFFORD TO
BE COMPLACENT OR, WORSE STILL, UNCARING. WE
SHOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT THE SWING TO LABOR
REFLECTED NOT SO MUCH A HIP-NERVE REACTION BUT
A GENUINE CONCERN ABOUT THE GROWING GAP
BETWEEN THE HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS IN THE
COMMUNITY. THERE HAS BEEN A TOUCH OF
CALLOUSNESS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC
POLICIES AND SCANT RECOGNITION THAT THE
UNEMPLOYED ARE BEARING A DISPROPORTIONATELY
HEAVY SHARE OF THE BURDEN OF THE SLOW HAUL
TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THE IMPORTANCE OF HOLDING
DOWN INFLATION AND CONSERVING ENERGY ARE NOT
TO BE UNDER-ESTIMATED, BUT THERE IS NO EXCUSE
FOR PREVALENCE OF POVERTY - WHATEVER THE
ARGUMENTS ABOUT NUMBERS AND STANDARDS -
IN A LAND OF PLENTY. AND NOW THAT THE ELECTION
IS OVER, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD LOSE NO TIME
IN FORMULATING RATIONAL AND EFFECTIVE POLICIES
TO ENSURE RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF THE
RESOURCES BOOM AND AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION
OF ITS BENEFITS. THE RESTRUCTURING OF AUSTRALIAN
INDUSTRY AND THE PROBLEMS OF TECHNOLOGICAL
CHANGES ARE TWO RELATED CHALLENGES THE
GOVERNMENT CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO EVADE OR
DEFER.
FOR MR HAYDEN, THE TASK OF THE NEXT THREE
YEARS IS TO CONSOLIDATE HIS AUTHORITY AS LABOR'S
LEADER, TO DEVELOP FURTHER A CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE
AND TO HOLD THE DISPARATE ELEMENTS OF THE LABOR
MOVEMENT TOGETHER. HE HAS REALISED, EVEN IF
OTHERS IN THE PARTY HAVE NOT, THAT LABOR'S
ELECTORAL SUCCESS LIES IN MODERATION AND CAUTION.
WHAT HE MUST ALSO RECOGNISE IS THAT HE WOULD DO
BETTER TO EMPHASISE THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF
LABOR'S ALTERNATIVE THAN TO APPEAR TO BE
CONSTANTLY NIGGLING ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S
PERFORMANCE OR PERSONALITIES. FOR MR FRASER, THE
LESSON OF THE ELECTION SHOULD BE THAT CONCILIATION
AND CONCERN ARE PREFERABLE TO CONFRONTATION AND
DIVISION. THERE ARE OMINOUS SIGNS THAT
AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY IS BECOMING MORE POLARISED, A
TREND LIKELY TO BE ACCENTUATED BY STRUCTURAL AND
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. AS IN 1975 AND 1977, MR
FRASER HAS PROMISED TO GOVERN IN THE INTERESTS
NOT ONLY OF THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT
BUT OF ALL AUSTRALIANS. FOR THE SAKE OF SOCIAL
JUSTICE AND POLITICAL STABILITY, WE HOPE THAT THIS
TIME HE WILL SHOW THAT HE MEANS IT.
<F26>
TUESDAY 21 OCTOBER 1980
"THE FUTURE OF MR MARCOS"
PRESIDENT MARCOS OF THE PHILIPPINES
LIKES TO TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIFTING
MARTIAL LAW EARLY NEXT YEAR. THE 63-YEAR-OLD
STRONGMAN, WHO WAS JUST A FEW METRES REMOVED
FROM A BOMB EXPLOSION YESTERDAY, IS ACCUSED
OF MANY THINGS. BUT IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT
HE IS IGNORANT OF THE GENERAL RESENTMENT
IN HIS COUNTRY TODAY AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF
AUTHORITARIANISM. MR MARCOS HAS A SHREWD
IDEA OF JUST HOW FAR HE CAN PUSH HIS FELLOW
FILIPINOS, AND HOW BEST TO EXPLOIT THE DIVISIONS
WITHIN THE OPPOSITION AND THE INFLUENTIAL ROMAN
CATHOLIC CHURCH. BUT THE PRESSURES OF 1980 ARE
SUCH THAT MR MARCOS IS PROBABLY SINCERE IN
HIS PROFESSED DESIRE TO END ONE-MAN MARTIAL
RULE, AT LEAST IN NAME IF NOT ALTOGETHER IN FACT.
HOWEVER, HE HAS ATTACHED TWO CONDITIONS:
AN END TO THE MOSLEM REBELLION IN THE SOUTH,
AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE ECONOMY. EVEN IF
MARTIAL LAW DID COME TO AN END IN MARCH
NEXT YEAR - AND RECENT EVENTS SURELY MILITATE
AGAINST IT - WHAT WOULD BE THROWN UP IN ITS
PLACE? MR MARCOS'S PRIMARY GOAL WOULD APPEAR
TO BE THE RETENTION OF POWER FOR HIMSELF AND
TO KEEP THE FLAME ALIGHT FOR THE AMBITIOUS MRS
IMELDA MARCOS, WHO NO DOUBT WANTS TO SUCCEED
HER HUSBAND. TO THIS END, THEREFORE, MR MARCOS
COULD DRAW ON HIS FUND OF CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENTS, WHICH WOULD ENSURE HIS RETENTION
OF THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP AND PROVIDE FOR
AUTHORITARIAN RULE EVEN WITHOUT THE MARTIAL
LAW BLANKET.
FOR THE MOMENT HE HAS PLENTY OF
AMMUNITION WITH WHICH TO JUSTIFY THE STATUS
QUO. HE CAN POINT TO THE WAVE OF URBAN VIOLENCE,
TO AN ECONOMY THAT IS GETTING WORSE INSTEAD
OF BETTER, AND TO A WIDENING OF THE ETHNIC
REBELLIONS. WHAT MAY WORK FOR MR MARCOS IN
THE SHORT TERM, THOUGH, COULD EVENTUALLY
OVERWHELM HIM. SOME OBSERVERS SUGGEST THAT THE
CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE IN RECENT WEEKS HAS ARISEN
FROM DISAFFECTED ELEMENTS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS,
WHICH HAS BEEN ANGERED INTELLECTUALLY BY THE
LACK OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AND HURT FINANCIALLY BY THE
PARLOUS STATE OF THE ECONOMY. EVEN IF THIS
SUGGESTION IS UNFOUNDED, THERE SEEMS LITTLE
DOUBT THAT OPPOSITION TO THE REGIME IS GROWING
AS RESENTMENT MOUNTS AGAINST MILITARY ZEAL,
CORRUPTION IN HIGH PLACES AND THE LOWER STANDARD
OF LIVING.
IT IS SAID THAT MR MARCOS, WHO HAS BEEN
WATER-SKIING FOR THE PRESS IN ORDER TO ALLAY
SUSPICIONS ABOUT HIS HEALTH, CAN MAINTAIN HIS
GRIP ON POWER AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS THE
SUPPORT OF THE MILITARY AT HOME AND OF INVESTORS
ABROAD. HIS DOMESTIC PROP SEEMS SECURE ENOUGH.
AFTER ALL, THE ARMY ENJOYS A PRIVILEGED POSITION
UNDER MARTIAL LAW AND HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN
SEEING MR MARCOS ON TOP. OF COURSE, IT IS
UNPOPULAR FOR ABUSING ITS POWERS, AND THE FEAR
IS THAT IT WOULD WANT TO STAY ON THE STREETS
EVEN IF MARTIAL LAW DISAPPEARED TOMORROW. MR
MARCOS'S OTHER PROP IS NOT SO SECURE. FOREIGN
INVESTORS, PARTICULARLY THE UNITED STATES, ARE
DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PHILIPPINES TODAY.
MONEY IS FLOWING OUT OF MANILA FASTER THAN
IT CAN BE REPLACED. THE TOURIST DOLLAR, TOO, AS
IMPORTANT AS THE INVESTMENT DOLLAR, IS SUFFERING
IN THE WAVE OF BOMBINGS AGAINST HOTELS. IN THE
FACE OF ALL THIS, THE OPPOSITION GROUPS STILL CANNOT
FIND IT IN THEMSELVES TO AGREE ON ANYTHING
BEYOND THEIR SHARED GOAL OF REMOVING MR
MARCOS, FOR WHICH MARTIAL LAW RESTRICTIONS ON
POLITICAL ACTIVITY ARE PARTLY TO BLAME. PERHAPS
THE MOST HOPEFUL OPPOSITION FIGURE IS FORMER
SENATOR AQUINO, NOW IN EXILE IN THE UNITED
STATES AND AROUND WHOM A MODERATE MOVEMENT
MAY GROW TO PROVIDE THE OPPOSITION WITH
CREDIBILITY, NOT ONLY AT HOME BUT ALSO IN
WASHINGTON.
MR MARCOS'S GREAT COMFORT THIS WEEK IS THAT
HIS OPPONENTS HAVE YET TO THROW UP A SERIOUS
ALTERNATIVE TO HIS RULE. THE PRESIDENT HAS A
CHOICE. HE COULD NEGOTIATE WITH THE MODERATE
FACTIONS OF THE OPPOSITION. OR HE COULD TAKE NEW
REPRESSIVE MEASURES IN WHICH THE MILITARY
BECAME HIS CHIEF INSTRUMENT TO RETAIN POWER. IT
IS FEARED THAT THE CHANCE FOR A PEACEFUL
TRANSITION MAY HAVE SLIPPED FROM MR MARCOS'S
HANDS ALREADY.
"WRONG COURSE ON ADOPTION"
UNDER A BILL INTRODUCED LAST MONTH IN THE
VICTORIAN PARLIAMENT AND DUE TO BE DEBATED
ON THURSDAY, ADOPTED CHILDREN WILL BE ABLE TO
APPLY FOR ACCESS TO THEIR ORIGINAL BIRTH
CERTIFICATES ONCE THEY TURN 18, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
CONDITIONS. AT FIRST GLANCE THIS MAY SEEM A
REASONABLY ENLIGHTENED LAW, AS WELL AS A MARKED
IMPROVEMENT ON THE STATUS QUO. CERTAINLY THAT
IS HOW THE MINISTER FOR COMMUNITY AND WELFARE
SERVICES, MR JONA, WOULD LIKE IT TO BE REGARDED.
IN THIS, HOWEVER, HE AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE IN
A MINORITY POSITION. AGAINST THEM ARE RANGED A
HOST OF SOCIAL WELFARE ORGANISATIONS, ALL OF WHICH
HAVE BRANDED THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AS
COSMETIC, INADEQUATE AND UNLIKELY TO HAVE ANY
REAL IMPACT. THESE ORGANISATIONS INCLUDE
ADOPTIVE PARENTS, ADOPTED PERSONS AND NATURAL
PARENTS - THE THREE GROUPS WHOSE RIGHTS AND
INTERESTS ARE AT STAKE. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO
COME UNDER FIRE FROM ITS OWN STANDING
COMMITTEE ON ADOPTION, WHICH WANTS THE BILL
WITHDRAWN AND A NEW BILL DRAFTED AFTER PUBLIC
DEBATE.
CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANNED
AMENDMENTS HAS CENTRED ON TWO MAIN PROVISIONS.
ONE IS THAT THE RIGHT OF AN ADOPTED PERSON TO
INFORMATION ABOUT HIS NATURAL PARENTS SHOULD BE
CONDITIONAL ON THE NATURAL MOTHER'S APPROVAL.
THE OTHER IS THAT THE CONCESSION WILL APPLY ONLY
TO PEOPLE ADOPTED AFTER THE AMENDMENTS ARE
PASSED AND BECOME LAW. IN OTHER WORDS, IT WILL
BEGIN TO TAKE PRACTICAL EFFECT ONLY AFTER 1998.
THE GOVERNMENT'S STANDING COMMITTEE ON
ADOPTION ARGUES THAT AN ADOPTED PERSON IS
ENTITLED TO A COPY OF HIS OR HER ORIGINAL BIRTH
CERTIFICATE, AND THAT THIS RIGHT SHOULD NOT BE
CONDITIONAL ON THE COURTS OR SUBJECT TO THE
NATURAL MOTHER'S CONSENT. IT ALSO ARGUES THAT
THE LAW SHOULD BE RETROSPECTIVE. OTHERWISE, IT
SAYS, THE 57,000 ADOPTED PERSONS IN VICTORIA
(NEARLY HALF OF WHOM ARE ADULTS)WOULD CONTINUE
TO HAVE NO RIGHTS.
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SENSITIVE AREA, AND THE
RIGHTS OF MORE THAN THE ADOPTED PERSON HAVE TO
BE CONSIDERED. NONETHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT'S
ATTITUDE DOES SEEM EXCESSIVELY CAUTIOUS. IN
ENGLAND, SCOTLAND AND IN OTHER PLACES WHERE
ADOPTED PERSONS NOW HAVE RETROSPECTIVE ACCESS
TO THEIR ORIGINAL BIRTH RECORDS, THE PROBLEMS
CREATED BY THE LEGISLATION HAVE BEEN MINIMAL. IN
FACT, VERY FEW ADOPTED PERSONS HAVE SOUGHT TO
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LAW AT ALL - A FACT WHICH
SUGGESTS THAT THE FEARS HELD BY SOME
GOVERNMENT MEMBERS ARE EXAGGERATED.
SOME ADOPTIVE PARENTS MAY BE WORRIED
ABOUT A LAW GIVING THEIR ADOPTED CHILDREN
UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR
BIRTH. THEY MAY FEAR THAT SUCH INFORMATION WILL
DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN THEM AND THE CHILD WHO
IS LEGALLY THEIRS. THERE IS A SIMPLE WAY ROUND
THIS, AND THAT IS TO SET UP A CONTACT REGISTER
WHERE ADULTS WHO HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AND THEIR
NATURAL PARENTS CAN INDEPENDENTLY REGISTER THEIR
NAMES. IF THE NATURAL MOTHER DID NOT WANT
CONTACT WITH HER CHILD, SHE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT
TO SAY SO, AND HER OBJECTION WOULD BE RESPECTED.
OTHERWISE, THE INFORMATION WOULDBE FREELY
AVAILABLE TO ADOPTED PERSONS OVER THE AGE OF 18.
SOME FORM OF COMPULSORY COUNSELLING
BEFOREHAND MIGHT BE SENSIBLE. INDIVIDUAL
MEMBERS OF THE ADOPTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION
OF VICTORIA HAVE RECOMMENDED SUCH A MOVE,
AND THEIR VIEW ON THIS AND ALSO RETROSPECTIVITY
(WHICH MOST MEMBERS SUPPORT) DESERVES
CONSIDERATION BY THE GOVERNMENT. MR JONA
SHOULD RECONSIDER HIS BILL.
<F27>
WEDNESDAY 22 OCTOBER 1980
"GOOD DECISION FOR MELBOURNE"
MELBOURNE IS A CITY OF INDECISION.
DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES COME AND GO. THOSE
THAT ARE TRANSLATED INTO BRICKS AND MORTAR
GENERALLY ARE UNCO-ORDINATED. PLANNING POLICIES
ARE CONFUSING. IT IS NOT THAT MELBOURNE IS
AIMLESS. CLEAR GOALS WERE SET FOR THE CENTRAL
BUSINESS DISTRICT AND THE INNER AREAS IN A
STRATEGY PLAN PREPARED AT A COST OF $400,000
FOR THE MELBOURNE CITY COUNCIL BY AN
INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM OF PLANNERS IN 1973. THE
PLAN WAS ACCEPTED BY THE COUNCIL, THE STATE
GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC AS AN EXCITING AND
REALISTIC BLUEPRINT FOR MELBOURNE'S HEART. BUT
LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE TO IMPLEMENT IT. THE COUNCIL
CLAIMS 17 OF THE 20 ACTION PLANS HAVE BEEN
COMMENCED, BUT IN MANY CASES THAT MEANS
SIMPLY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN FURTHER DISCUSSIONS.
APART FROM THE BOURKE STREET MALL, WHICH IS
ANYTHING BUT A CREDIT TO MELBOURNE IN ITS PRESENT
FORM, THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL RECOMMENDATIONS -
THOSE REQUIRING THE GREATEST CHANGE - HAVE NOT
BEEN IMPLEMENTED.
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PLAN PROPOSED THAT
OFFICE AND RETAIL DEVELOPMENTS BE CONCENTRATED
IN THE CBD, THE AREA BEST SERVED BY PUBLIC
TRANSPORT AND ROADS. ROYAL PARADE, ST KILDA
ROAD, QUEENS ROAD AND MUCH OF EAST MELBOURNE
WERE TO BE OUT-OF-BOUNDS TO THE DEVELOPERS OF
HIGH-RISE OFFICES. WITH THE UNDERGROUND RAIL LOOP
BEING BUILT TO SUPPLEMENT THE CITY-BASED TRAINS,
TRAMS AND BUSES THAT ALREADY SERVED MOST OF
MELBOURNE'S DORMITORY SUBURBS, IT WAS A SENSIBLE
SUGGESTION. ALSO, IT WAS A WAY OF SHIELDING THE
BOULEVARDS THAT FEED THE CITY FROM MORE VISUALLY
INTRUSIVE OFFICE TOWERS AND CAR PARKS. THE MCC
HAS MADE A FEW HALF-HEARTED ATTEMPTS TO
IMPLEMENT THIS PART OF THE PLAN. BUT WITHOUT AN
AMENDMENT TO THE BOARD OF WORKS' METROPOLITAN
PLANNING SCHEME IT COULD NOT ENFORCE THE BUILDING
CONTROLS. IT CAME CLOSE TO SEEKING SUCH AN
AMENDMENT IN 1977 BUT, UNDER PRESSURE FROM
PROPERTY DEVELOPERS, IT BACKED DOWN. ANYWAY,
THE NEIGHBORING SUBURBAN COUNCILS THAT HAVE
PLANNING RESPONSIBILITY FOR PARTS OF THE SAME
BOULEVARDS DID NOT AGREE WITH THE PROPOSED
LIMITS.
THE BOARD'S PLANNING SCHEME IS LAW. WHILE IT
EXISTS IN ITS PRESENT FORM, WITHOUT AN AMENDMENT
ALONG THE LINES PROPOSED IN THE STRATEGY PLAN,
THE MCC IS HAMSTRUNG. IF IT REFUSES APPROVAL
FOR A 20-STOREY OFFICE BLOCK IN, SAY, ST KILDA
ROAD, THE DEVELOPER NEED ONLY APPEAL TO THE
TOWN PLANNING APPEALS TRIBUNAL TO HAVE THE
DECISION OVERTURNED. THE DEVELOPER WOULD BE
WITHIN HIS RIGHTS TO DO SO, AND THE TRIBUNAL
WOULD BE OBLIGED TO OVER-RULE THE COUNCIL. BUT
NOW THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED IN. AFTER
FAILING EARLIER THIS YEAR TO GET SOME SORT OF
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE MCC, INNER SUBURBAN
COUNCILS, THE BOARD OF WORKS (WHICH HAS NEVER
ACCEPTED THAT COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT SHOULD
BE RESTRICTED TO THE CBD) AND THE TOWN AND
COUNTRY PLANNING BOARD ON BUILDING LIMITS ALONG
THE BOULEVARDS, IT HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO
IMPOSE ITS OWN CONTROLS.
THE CONTROLS ARE AIMED AT ENCOURAGING LOW-
RISE, MAINLY RESIDENTIAL, DEVELOPMENTS ALONG THE
BOULEVARDS AND IN PARTS OF EAST MELBOURNE AND
CARLTON; CONCENTRATION OF NEW OFFICE
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CBD, AND LIMITING THE HEIGHT
OF COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AROUND PARKS AND IN THE
VICINITY OF PARLIAMENT HOUSE. UNDER NORMAL
CIRCUMSTANCES, STATE INTERFERENCE IN SUCH MATTERS
WOULD WARRANT CRITICISM. BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS
TO BE WELCOMED. THE COUNCILS HAVE BEEN UNABLE
TO REACH AGREEMENT. THE BOARD OF WORKS SEEMS
TO WANT DEVELOPMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT'S SAKE.
MEANWHILE, MELBOURNE IS A SHAMBLES. HOW CAN
WE MAKE BEST USE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND ROADS
IF DEVELOPMENT IS ALLOWED TO SPREAD? HOW CAN
WE ENTICE MORE PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THE INNER
SUBURBS AND TO SHOP AND WORK IN THE CITY IF IT IS
AN UNATTRACTIVE HOTCH-POTCH OF CAR PARKS,
OVERWHELMING OFFICE TOWERS AND NOISY AND
CONGESTED BOULEVARDS? A COMPACT BUSINESS
DISTRICT SURROUNDED BY A BUFFER ZONE OF PARKS
AND WELCOMING RESIDENTIAL AREAS IS BEST FOR
MELBOURNE.
"SHOPPING HOURS TOO RESTRICTED"
THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS TREADING GINGERLY ON
CONTROVERSIAL GROUND IN TRYING TO RECOGNISE
SOCIAL CHANGE, RECONCILE CONFLICTING INTERESTS AND
INTRODUCE MORE RATIONALITY INTO ITS REVISION OF
VICTORIA'S ANOMALOUS TRADING LAWS. THESE ARE
STILL PARTLY BOUND BY WARTIME RESTRICTIONS
IMPOSED 40 YEARS AGO TO RELEASE MANPOWER FOR
INDUSTRY AND BY THE HERITAGE OF SUNDAY
OBSERVANCE LAWS. OVER RECENT YEARS, WHILE
BANKING AND POSTAL SERVICES HAVE BECOME MORE
RESTRICTED, TRADING HOURS HAVE BEEN
INCREASINGLY RELAXED. THE RESULT IS AN
EXTRAORDINARY HOTCHPOTCH OF LEGISLATION
DETAILING WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE SOLD AT
VARIOUS TIMES OF THE DAY AND DAYS OF THE WEEK
IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHOP AND LOCALITY.
THE REMAINING RESTRICTIONS, ESPECIALLY
THOSE GOVERNING SHOPPING BETWEEN 1 PM ON
SATURDAY AND MIDNIGHT ON SUNDAY, HAVE
BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE AND
ARE BEING WIDELY FLOUTED. THE DEMAND FOR
LONGER AND MORE FLEXIBLE TRADING HOURS HAS
ARISEN MAINLY FROM CHANGING SOCIAL PATTERNS
AND A MORE COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL
ENVIRONMENT. THE VAST INCREASE IN THE NUMBER
OF WIVES IN THE WORKFORCE AND YOUNG SINGLE
PEOPLE LIVING AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY HOME HAS
MEANT THAT FOR MUCH OF THE POPULATION THE
SHOPPING HOURS OF 20 TO 40 YEARS AGO WERE FAR
TOO RESTRICTED. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-SERVICE
SUPERMARKETS, REGIONAL SHOPPING CENTRES,
DISCOUNT STORES AND OPEN-AIR MARKETS, THE
INCREASE IN LEISURE ACTIVITIES AND COMPARISONS
WITH OVERSEAS BY A MORE WIDELY TRAVELLED
PUBLIC HAVE ADDED TO THE PRESSURES FOR
LIBERALISED TRADING.
THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGISLATIVE CHANGE IN
RECENT YEARS WAS TO PERMIT LATE-NIGHT TRADING
ON WEEKDAYS. FRIDAY NIGHT SHOPPING HAS NOT
BEEN AS POPULAR AS IT WAS BEFORE THE WAR, BUT
THE LATE CLOSING OF SUPERMARKETS HAS BEEN A
BOON TO WORKING WIVES AND SINGLE PERSONS.
NOW THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO ALLOW SMALL
SHOPS TO OPEN ON SATURDAY AFTER 1 PM, AND THE
RETAIL TRADERS ASSOCIATION WANTS THIS
LIBERALISATION TO BE EXTENDED TO ALL RETAILERS,
BIG AND SMALL. THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION IS
NOT PURELY TO MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR CONSUMERS.
IT HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE TO COUNTER THE
COMPETITIVE GROWTH OF AFTER-HOURS SHOPPING
CHAINS AND SERVICE STATION SHOPS SELLING THE
GROWING LIST OF GOODS EXEMPTED FROM TRADING
RESTRICTIONS.
THE MOVE IS STRONGLY OPPOSED BY THE SHOP
ASSISTANTS' UNION (SDAEA) WHICH CLAIMS THAT
SINCE NIGHT SHOPPING WAS INTRODUCED IN 1971,
SOME 8000 SMALL SHOPS HAVE GONE OUT OF
BUSINESS, 30,000 FULL-TIME JOBS HAVE BEEN LOST,
AND PRICES HAVE BEEN BOOSTED BY 6 PER CENT.
HOW THESE ALLEGED LOSSES AND COSTS CAN BE
ISOLATED FROM OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS COMPETITION
FROM NEWER, LARGER OUTLETS, OR THE IMPACT OF
RECESSION AND LOWERED PURCHASING POWER, OR THE
EFFECT OF HIGH PENALTY RATES FOR WEEKEND AND
NIGHT WORK, IS NOT CLEAR. THE RETAIL TRADERS
ASSERT THAT EXTENDED HOURS STIMULATE SALES AND
INCREASE FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME JOB
OPPORTUNITIES (IF NOT UNION MEMBERSHIP) WITHOUT
NECESSARILY INCREASING PRICES. WHERE THE TRUTH
LIES IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS, BUT IS IT REALLY FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO ADJUDICATE? IN PRINCIPLE, THE LESS
REGULATION THERE IS OVER BUSINESS THE BETTER,
AND IF ANY INTEREST OUGHT TO BE PROTECTED IT IS
THAT OF THE CONSUMER. RETAIL TRADING, OF ALL
FORMS OF BUSINESS, IS THE MOST RESPONSIVE TO THE
CUSTOMER, AND SHOULD BE LEAST RESTRICTED IN
PRACTICE. WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO
DISCRIMINATE IN FAVOR OF ONE TYPE OF RETAIL OUTLET
AGAINST ANOTHER IS ALSO DOUBTFUL. IF THE
WHOLESALE DISMANTLING OF RESTRICTIONS IS TOO
DRASTIC FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTEMPLATE, THEN
IT MIGHT CONSIDER THE CONCEPT OF STAGGERED
HOURS, SO THAT ANY GOODS ARE AVAILABLE WHEN
PEOPLE MIGHT REASONABLY WISH TO BUY THEM.
<F28>
THURSDAY 23 OCTOBER 1980
"ON THE DRUGS TREADMILL"
IN ANNOUNCING NEW MEASURES TO COUNTER DRUG
ABUSE, THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS LOCKED
ITSELF EVEN MORE FIRMLY INTO THE PROHIBITIVE,
PUNITIVE APPROACH OF TOUGHER LAW ENFORCEMENT
AND HARSHER PENALTIES. THIS IS NOT SURPRISING. IT
SATISFIES POPULAR ANXIETY AND INDIGNATION, AND
IT PERSUADES POLITICIANS AND PUBLIC THAT
SOMETHING USEFUL IS BEING DONE. IT IS EASIER TO
LEGISLATE THAN TO ASK WHY PEOPLE TURN TO
HARMFUL DRUGS, AND MUCH LESS DISCONCERTING
THAN TO CONFRONT THE ANSWERS SUCH AN INQUIRY
MIGHT PRODUCE. THERE IS DEPRESSINGLY LITTLE
EVIDENCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE TOUGH LAW AND
ORDER APPROACH DOES MUCH TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM;
ON THE CONTRARY, THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST
THAT IT AGGRAVATES IT. BUT THE LEGISLATORS AND
ENFORCERS REMAIN UNDETERRED. IN AUSTRALIA THE
PATTERN SEEMS TO BE FOLLOWING THAT OF THE
UNITED STATES: TOUGH LAWS AND HIGH PENALTIES,
GREATER CRIMINAL ORGANISATION AND POLICE
CORRUPTION, A WIDER SPREAD OF DRUG ABUSE,
FOLLOWED BY TOUGHER LAWS AND HIGHER PENALTIES,
AND SO ON UNTIL THE PROBLEM BECOMES
INCREASINGLY ENTRENCHED AND INTRACTABLE.
THE GOVERNMENT'S LATEST PROPOSALS FALL INTO
TWO CATEGORIES, ONE DEALING WITH ILLEGAL DRUGS
AND THE OTHER WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THEY
MAY BE CONSIDERED SEPARATELY. THE MAXIMUM
PENALTY FOR TRAFFICKING IN DANGEROUS NARCOTICS
SUCH AS HEROIN AND COCAINE IS TO BE INCREASED
FROM 15 YEARS' IMPRISONMENT AND/OR A $100,000
FINE TO 25 YEARS' IMPRISONMENT AND/OR A
$200,000 FINE. THE PENALTIES FOR POSSESSION ARE
ALSO GREATLY INCREASED. THE RATIONALE FOR THESE
HIGHER PENALTIES, OTHER THAN TO BRING THEM INTO
LINE WITH THOSE IN NEW SOUTH WALES, IS NOT
EXPLAINED. PERHAPS THEY ARE INTENDED TO
FRIGHTEN OFF POTENTIAL COURIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS.
BUT DETERRENCE DEPENDS MORE ON CERTAINTY OF
DETECTION AND CONVICTION THAN ON THE THREAT OF
DIRE PUNISHMENT. THE COMMONWEALTH ROYAL
COMMISSIONER INTO DRUGS, MR JUSTICE WILLIAMS,
OBSERVED: "IT IS A FAR GREATER DETERRENT THAT
NINE TRAFFICKERS GO TO JAIL FOR FIVE YEARS EACH
THAN THAT ONE IS SENTENCED TO JAIL FOR LIFE". HE
ALSO NOTED THAT THE PRESENT APPROACH OF
PUNISHING DRUG DEALERS SEVERELY WHILE SHOWING
RELATIVE LENIENCY TOWARDS USERS WAS NOT LOGICAL,
"BECAUSE NEARLY ALL USERS ARE TRAFFICKERS, ALBEIT
ON A MINOR SCALE". MOST HEROIN ADDICTS CAN
FEED THEIR HABIT ONLY BY SELLING TO OTHERS, OR
BY RESORTING TO CRIME OR PROSTITUTION. MORE
EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN, IN FACT,
COMPOUND THE PROBLEM, BY RAISING THE PRICE OF
SUPPLIES AND FORCING ADDICTS TO PUSH OR STEAL
OR SOLICIT ALL THE MORE.
THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO SIMPLIFY THE
OFFENCE OF TRAFFICKING, &C, IN CANNABIS
(MARIJUANA) BY FIXING A SINGLE MAXIMUM
PENALTY OF 10 YEARS' IMPRISONMENT AND/OR A
$50,000 FINE, REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OR POTENCY
OF THE CANNABIS PRODUCT. EVEN THIS PENALTY IS
OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE KNOWN AND SUPPOSED
HARMFUL EFFECTS OF USING CANNABIS, ESPECIALLY
WHEN COMPARED WITH THE ENORMOUS SOCIAL COSTS
OF ALCOHOL ABUSE. THE INTRODUCTION OF A SIMILAR
PENALTY SPECIFICIALLY FOR THE CULTIVATION OF A
CANNABIS PLANT IS SIMPLY LUDICROUS, AND ONE CAN
ONLY HOPE THAT THE COURTS WILL DRAW AN
APPROPRIATE DISCRETIONARY DISTINCTION BETWEEN
A HOME BACKYARD POT PLANT AND A MARKETABLE
PLANTATION CULTIVATED FOR PROFIT.
THE PROPOSALS TO TIGHTEN UP REGULATIONS
RELATING TO ABUSE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE MORE
USEFUL. THE WIDESPREAD MISUSE OF THESE DRUGS
AND THE HARMFUL AND COSTLY CONSEQUENCES HAVE
BEEN RELATIVELY NEGLECTED WHILE PUBLIC OPINION
HAS FOCUSED ON THE MORE LIMITED PROBLEM OF
ILLEGAL DRUGS. TRAFFICKING IN RESTRICTED DRUGS
SUCH AS BARBITURATES WILL ATTRACT THE SAME
PENALTY AS TRAFFICKING IN CANNABIS. THIS SEEMS
EXCESSIVE BUT IS CERTAINLY MORE LOGICAL THAN THE
CONTRACT OF THE FORMER MAXIMUM PENALTY OF A
$100 FINE. FORGING A PRESCRIPTION AND FALSE
REPRESENTATION FOR OBTAINING A PRESCRIPTION OF A
RESTRICTED DRUG BECOMES PUNISHABLE BY UP TO TWO
YEARS' JAIL. HERE IT MUST BE ASKED WHETHER
SOMEONE DESPERATE ENOUGH TO COMMIT THESE
OFFENCES TO OBTAIN DRUGS ON WHICH HE HAS BECOME
DEPENDENT (AS DISTINCT FROM TRYING TO OBTAIN
THEM FOR TRAFFICKING FOR PROFIT) SHOULD BE
TREATED AS A CRIMINAL TO BE PUNISHED RATHER THAN
A PERSON IN NEED OF HELP. THE WORKING PARTY ON
WHOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THE PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE
CHANGES ARE BASED HAS ALSO CALLED FOR MORE
EFFECTIVE EARLY INTERVENTION, TREATMENT AND
REHABILITATION. THESE MEASURES DESERVE HIGHER
PRIORITY THAN THE MORE DRAMATIC GESTURE OF
INCREASING PENALTIES.
"PROBE INTO THE NEWSPAPERS"
LAST DECEMBER THE PREMIER, MR HAMER, SAID
HE WOULD REFER THE QUESTION OF NEWSPAPER
OWNERSHIP IN VICTORIA TO THE ALL-PARTY
PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON COMPANY TAKEOVERS.
WHAT PROMPTED HIM TO DO SO - ALTHOUGH IT NOW
SEEMS TO HAVE SLIPPED HIS MEMORY - WAS MR
RUPERT MURDOCH'S BOLD BUT ABORTIVE BID TO
ACQUIRE A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE HERALD AND
WEEKLY TIMES. SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN MR
HAMER HAS BEEN ASKED WHEN HE INTENDED TO MAKE
GOOD HIS PROMISE. YESTERDAY HE SUPPLIED THE
ANSWER. AN INQUIRY INTO NEWSPAPER OWNERSHIP
IN VICTORIA HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED. HOWEVER, IT WILL
BE CARRIED OUT, NOT BY A COMMITTEE OF PARLIAMENT,
BUT BY A RETIRED SUPREME COURT JUDGE, MR JUSTICE
NORRIS, SITTING ALONE. PUBLIC SUBMISSIONS WILL BE
INVITED, AT WHICH POINT THE GOVERNMENT WILL
DECIDE WHETHER THE HEARING (FOR WHICH NO FIXED
TIME LIMIT HAS BEEN SET) WILL BE PUBLIC OR NOT.
WHEN THE ORIGINAL INQUIRY WAS MOOTED WE
WELCOMED IT WITH RESERVATIONS. A CONCENTRATION
OF MEDIA OWNERSHIP IS UNDESIRABLE AT ANY TIME,
WHETHER IN TELEVISION, RADIO OR NEWSPAPERS. THIS
WAS THE VIEW TAKEN RECENTLY BY THE AUSTRALIAN
BROADCASTING TRIBUNAL IN ITS DECISION ON THE
OWNERSHIP OF THE MELBOURNE TV STATION CHANNEL
10. IT IS A SOUND PRINCIPLE. THE GREATER THE
NUMBER OF PUBLIC VOICES, THE LESS CHANCE THERE
IS OF ONE COMPANY OR ONE INDIVIUAL CONTROLLING,
AND PERHAPS MANIPULATING, PUBLIC OPINION.
UNDER THE TERMS OF REFERENCE MR JUSTICE
NORRIS WILL BE LOOKING AT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE
NEWSPAPERS OF VICTORIA ARE CONCENTRATED IN
PARTICULAR HANDS, AND WHETHER IT WOULD BE IN THE
PUBLIC INTEREST FOR THE CONTROL AND OWNERSHIP OF
THOSE PUBLISHING COMPANIES TO BE REGULATED. ONE
POINT WHICH THE INQUIRY WILL HAVE TO DECIDE IS AT
WHAT STAGE, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, GOVERNMENTS
SHOULD INTERVENE TO PREVENT MONOPOLIES.
THERE ARE CLEARLY DANGERS IN INTERVENTION.
THERE ARE ALSO PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES IN PREVENTING
ONE COMPANY FROM BUYING OUT ANOTHER. MARKET
FORCES ARE THEMSELVES A FACTOR IN OWNERSHIP
CONCENTRATION; AND SOMETIMES IT IS ONLY A WELL-
ESTABLISHED GROUP OR CHAIN WHICH CAN AFFORD TO
LAUNCH A NEW NEWSPAPER OR RESCUE AN AILING ONE.
IN GENERAL, THOUGH, WE WELCOME THE INQUIRY,
PARTICULARLY IF IT CAN COME UP WITH A SET OF
GROUND RULES AIMED AT PREVENTING FURTHER
CONCENTRATION OR, BETTER STILL, CREATING DIVERSITY.
HOWEVER, IF THE BOARD'S FINAL REPORT IS TO CARRY
WEIGHT, ITS SIZE SHOULD BE ENLARGED. MR JUSTICE
NORRIS, WHO IS GETTING ON IN YEARS, SAYS HE
KNOWS LITTLE ABOUT THE SUBJECT HE HAS BEEN ASKED
TO LOOK INTO. THAT IN ITSELF IS NOT NECESSARILY A
BAD THING; BUT HE WILL SURELY NEED ALONGSIDE HIM
AT LEAST ONE INDEPENDENT PERSON WHO UNDERSTANDS
THE BUSINESS.
BESIDES, THE INQUIRY SHOULD BE OPEN TO THE
PUBLIC FROM THE BEGINNING. IT WOULD BE ABSURD
TO HOLD AN INQUIRY INTO NEWSPAPERS, OF ALL THINGS,
AND TO KEEP THE PROCEEDINGS PRIVATE. THE POINT
OF THE INQUIRY, AFTER ALL, IS NOT TO PROTECT PRIVATE
INTERESTS, BUT TO ADVANCE THE PUBLIC INTEREST.
<F29>
FRIDAY 24 OCTOBER 1980
"THREE-WAY FIGHT IN QUEENSLAND"
WITH THE DUST OF THE FEDERAL ELECTIONS BARELY
SETTLED, QUEENSLANDERS ARE GETTING READY TO
GO THE POLLS AGAIN. IF THE PRELIMINARY COMMENTS
BY THE PREMIER, MR JOH BJELKE-PETERSEN, AND HIS
LIBERAL AND LABOR RIVALS ARE ANY GUIDE, IT WILL
BE A RUGGED CONTEST. THE LIBERALS AND THE
NATIONAL PARTY ARE STILL PARTNERS IN GOVERNMENT;
BUT IT IS A PARTNERSHIP OF CONVENIENCE ONLY:
BETWEEN NOW AND POLLING DAY, 29 NOVEMBER, THEY
WILL BE AT ONE ANOTHER'S THROATS. THE NATIONALS,
WHO HAVE 34 SEATS IN THE QUEENSLAND PARLIAMENT
COMPARED WITH THE LIBERALS' 25 AND LABOR'S 23,
WILL BE OUT TO ASSERT THEIR SUPREMACY ONCE AGAIN.
THE LIBERALS, FOR THEIR PART, HAVE SET THEMSELVES
THE DAUNTING TASK OF BECOMING SENIOR PARTNER IN
THE COALITION. BOTH PARTIES HAVE MUCH TO GAIN OR
LOSE, AND THE NO-HOLDS-BARRED FIGHT BETWEEN THEM
WILL PROBABLY OVERSHADOW THE OTHER CONTEST
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ALP.
TO GAIN OFFICE IN ITS OWN RIGHT LABOR WOULD
NEED A SWING OF MORE THAN 6 PER CENT. WHILE IT
POLLED CREDITABLY IN THE RECENT FEDERAL ELECTIONS,
ACHIEVING A 5.7 PER CENT IMPROVEMENT IN ITS VOTE,
A SWING OF THIS ORDER SEEMS IMPROBABLE. FOR
ONE THING THE STATE LABOR LEADER, MR ED CASEY,
IS AN UNINSPIRING FIGURE. FOR ANOTHER, LABOR
HAS BEEN RIVEN BY INTERNAL DISPUTES AND
WRANGLING BETWEEN THE OLD GUARD AND THE
INTERVENTIONISTS. THE TWO SIDES PATCHED UP THEIR
DIFFERENCES FOR THE RECENT ELECTION; BUT THERE IS
STILL MUCH BITTERNESS BETWEEN THEM. ONE OF THE
LEGACIES OF THE OLD GUARD, TOO, HAS BEEN POOR
BRANCH ORGANISATION; AND THIS IS LIKELY TO AFFECT
THE PARTY'S SHOWING ON ELECTION DAY.
IF THE LIBERALS ARE TO ACHIEVE THEIR
AMBITION OF TOPPLING MR BJELKE-PETERSEN AND
THE NATIONALS, A CONJUNCTION OF UNLIKELY
CIRCUMSTANCES IS NECESSARY. ONE IS FOR LABOR
TO IMPROVE ITS STANDING ALONG THE NORTHERN
COASTAL BELT IN SEATS AT PRESENT HELD BY THE
NATIONALS. THE OTHER IS FOR THE LIBERALS TO POLL
WELL IN AND AROUND BRISBANE AT LABOR'S EXPENSE.
IT SEEMS AN IMPROBABLE - ALTHOUGH BY NO
MEANS IMPOSSIBLE - SCENARIO, GIVEN THAT FOUR
OR FIVE SEATS IN THE BRISBANE AREA, AT PRESENT
HELD BY THE LIBERALS, COULD FALL TO LABOR WITH
A VERY SMALL SWING. THE LIBERALS COULD PICK UP
A COUPLE OF SEATS IN THE NORTH THEMSELVES. BUT
THEY WILL HAVE TO FIGHT HARD TO RETAIN THE TWO
GOLD COAST SEATS, SOUTHPORT AND SURFERS
PARADISE, WHICH THEY WON LAST TIME, BUT WHICH
THE NATIONALS ARE, PERHAPS, OPTIMISTICALLY,
DETERMINED TO WREST BACK.
SIX MONTHS AGO MR BJELKE-PETERSEN'S CONTROL
OVER BOTH HIS OWN PARTY AND THE GOVERNMENT
SEEMED TO BE SLIPPING. WHERE HE HAD ONCE BEEN
AN ASSURED VOTE-CATCHER, HE WAS BEGINNING TO
BE PERCEIVED AS A LIABILITY; AND THERE WAS
SPECULATION ABOUT A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR. TO DATE,
HOWEVER, ALL THE POLITICAL OBITUARIES WRITTEN FOR
THE WILY QUEENSLAND PREMIER HAVE PROVED
PREMATURE. HIS PERFORMANCE OF LATE HAS BEEN
LESS ABRASIVE AND LESS CONFRONTATIONAL. HE GOES
INTO THE ELECTION NOT ONLY WITH A COMFORTABLE
LEAD IN SEATS OVER HIS LIBERAL PARTNERS (HELPED
BY THE RURAL GERRYMANDER) BUT WITH THE
KNOWLEDGE THAT IF LABOR SHOWS A RESURGENCE AT
THE POLLS, IT IS THE LIBERAL PARTY AND NOT HIS
OWN NATIONAL PARTY WHICH IS LIKELY TO SUFFER
MOST. THE NATIONALS MAY LOSE A FEW SEATS ON
29 NOVEMBER; BUT AT THIS STAGE THEIR CHANCES OF
REMAINING THE SENIOR PARTNER IN THE GOVERNMENT
APPEAR FAIRLY GOOD.
"MURDER BY DEGREES"
THE LAW INSTITUTE, AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE
PROMINENT TRIAL LAWYER MR FRANK GALBALLY,
HAS REVIVED A LEGAL DEBATE ABOUT MURDER THAT
APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN SETTLED IN VICTORIA IN
1974. WITH THE SUPPORT OF INFLUENTIAL POLICE
OFFICERS, THE LAWYERS PLAN TO ASK THE STATE
GOVERNMENT TO INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF
DEGREES OF UNLAWFUL HOMICIDE TO REPLACE
THE OLD-ESTABLISHED CRIMES OF MURDER AND
MANSLAUGHTER. IN 1973, WHEN THE PENALTY FOR
MURDER IN VICTORIA WAS STILL DEATH (ALTHOUGH
RARELY INFLICTED), THE LAW REFORM COMMISSIONER,
MR T. W. SMITH, QC, WAS ASKED BY THE
GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE THE CONCEPT OF
DEGREES OF MURDER, THE IDEA BEING THAT CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT MIGHT BE RESERVED FOR THE MOST
SERIOUS TYPES OF MURDER.
AS IT HAPPENED, MR SMITH WAS NOT ASKED TO
REPORT ON WHETHER THE DEATH PENALTY SHOULD BE
ABOLISHED (IT WAS REPLACED BY MANDATORY LIFE
IMPRISONMENT IN 1975), BUT HE ADVISED AGAINST
A SYSTEM OF DEGREES OF HOMICIDE. HE SUGGESTED
THAT UNLAWFUL KILLING SHOULD NOT AMOUNT TO
MURDER UNLESS THERE WAS INTENT TO KILL (OR IF THE
PERSON REALISED HIS ACTIONS WERE CERTAIN OR MORE
LIKELY THAN NOT TO KILL). HE ALSO SPECIFICALLY
RECOMMENDED THAT MERCY KILLING CONTINUE TO BE
CLASSED AS MURDER.
MR GALBALLY ADVOCATES A SYSTEM, SIMILAR
TO THAT IN THE UNITED STATES, OF FOUR GRADES OF
UNLAWFUL HOMICIDE. FIRST-DEGREE MURDER,
PUNISHABLE BY MANDATORY LIFE IMPRISONMENT,
COULD COVER KILLING FOR GAIN, BY TERRORISTS AND
IN JAIL ESCAPES, AS WELL AS GROSSLY SADISTIC TYPES
OF MURDER. SECOND-DEGREE HOMICIDE WOULD
INCLUDE CRIMES OF PASSION AND THIRD-DEGREE
HOMICIDE WOULD COVER MERCY KILLING. WHAT NOW
IS HELD TO BE MANSLAUGHTER WOULD COME UNDER
FOURTH-DEGREE HOMICIDE. THIS GRADUATED
APPROACH HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES. IT RECOGNISES
THE REALITY THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL DEGREES OF
CULPABILITY OR MORAL GRAVITY IN THE DELIBERATE OR
GROSSLY NEGLIGENT TAKING OF HUMAN LIFE. IT
WOULD GIVE THE COURTS THE FLEXIBILITY TO CONVICT
ON THE APPROPRIATE CHARGE AND TO SENTENCE
ACCORDINGLY. MAXIMUM SENTENCES FOR EACH LEVEL
WOULD BE SET BY STATUTE. AT PRESENT, JURIES HAVE
THE OPTION ONLY OF CONVICTING OR ACQUITTING
SOMEONE ON A MURDER CHARGE, OR FINDING HIM
GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,
AND JUDGES HAVE NO OPTION BUT TO SENTENCE
SOMEONE CONVICTED OF MURDER TO LIFE
IMPRISONMENT. THE ACTUAL TERM SERVED IS
BEYOND THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS AND LEFT
TO EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT.
A SYSTEM OF DEGREES WOULD PROBABLY
OVERCOME JURIES' RELUCTANCE TO CONVICT WHERE
THEY SEE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES, AND COULD
LEAD TO SHORTER TRIALS. MR GALBALLY'S ARGUMENT,
SUPPORTED BY MANY OTHER CRIMINAL LAWYERS AND
CRIMINOLOGISTS AND SOME JUDGES, IS COMPELLING
AND DESERVES RECONSIDERATION BY THE STATE
GOVERNMENT.

"HOPE FOR THE HOSTAGES"
IT IS HAZARDOUS TO TRY TO INTERPRET EVENTS IN
IRAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH WESTERN LOGIC. THE
COUNTRY IS FULL OF SURPRISES, EVEN FOR NEIGHBORING
IRAQ, WHOSE HOPES FOR A QUICK MILITARY VICTORY
OVER THE IRANIANS HAVE PROVED ILL-FOUNDED. WHILE
IT WOULD BE IDLE TO PRETEND THAT MANY AMERICANS
WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE AYATOLLAH KHOMEINY GET
A BLOODY NOSE, THE INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES
LIES IN A PEACEFUL, UNITED AND INDEPENDENT IRAN.
FOR THE TIME BEING, HOWEVER, WASHINGTON'S MAIN
PREOCCUPATION IS TO SECURE THE RELEASE OF THE 52
AMERICAN HOSTAGES. TODAY, AFTER NEARLY A YEAR
OF CAPTIVITY, THE CAPTIVES APPEAR TO HAVE A REAL
PROSPECT OF FREEDOM.
WHY NOW? FIRST, PRESIDENT CARTER, UP FOR
RE-ELECTION ON 4 NOVEMBER, HAS BEEN MAKING
MOST OF THE RIGHT GESTURES TOWARDS IRAN IN RECENT
WEEKS. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE SIGHT OF 52
AMERICANS ON THEIR WAY HOME WOULD DO WONDERS
FOR MR CARTER'S STANDING IN A CLOSE ELECTION.
THERE IS EVEN A SLIGHT POSSIBILITY THAT THE IRANIAN
REVOLUTIONARIES, ALTHOUGH THEY HATE THE
PRESIDENT, MAY PREFER HIM TO MR RONALD REAGAN,
WHO APPARENTLY THINKS HE CAN SOLVE THE HOSTAGE
PROBLEM IN ONE DAY. SECOND, IRAN WOULD SEEM TO
NEED ALL THE FRIENDS AND ALL THE WESTERN
AMMUNITION AND SPARE PARTS IT CAN GET AS THE
WAR SPINS ON. THIRD, IRAN'S NEW PARLIAMENT, OR
MAJLIS, IS ABOUT TO DEBATE THE CONDITIONS
WASHINGTON WOULD HAVE TO MEET FOR THE HOSTAGES
TO BE RELEASED. FOURTH, THE ACTIVIST MOSLEM
ELEMENTS OF THE LEADERSHIP APPEAR TO BELIEVE THAT
THE AIMS BEHIND THE EMBASSY SEIZURE HAVE BEEN
FULFILLED.
IT IS THE FOURTH POINT THAT MATTERS, FOR IT
CUTS TO THE HEART OF WHAT REVOLUTIONARY IRAN IS
ALL ABOUT. THE KEY FACT ABOUT POLITICS IN IRAN
IS THAT TWO DISTINCT FACTIONS CAME TO POWER IN
THE REVOLUTION: NATIONALISTS AND ACTIVIST MOSLEMS.
THE NATIONALISTS ARE OF WESTERN EXPERIENCE AND
BENT. THE ACTIVISTS ESCHEW MODERNITY AND FOCUS
ON CULTURAL AND MORAL MATTERS. WHILE THE
NATIONALISTS STRESS IRAN AND THE 20TH CENTURY, THE
ACTIVISTS ARE PREOCCUPIED WITH ISLAM AND
TRADITION. IT IS A BATTLE FOR IRAN'S SOUL AS MUCH AS
ITS GOVERNMENT, AND ONE BY ONE THE NATIONALISTS
HAVE BEEN SQUEEZED OUT OF POWER. TO THIS END
THE HOSTAGES HAVE STRENGTHENED THE HAND OF THE
ACTIVIST POLITICAL LEADERS, WHO HAVE BENEFITED
DIRECTLY FROM THE STARTLING POWER AND ANTI-
NATIONALIST PUBLICITY GAINED BY THE CAPTORS.
THE ACTIVISTS NOW APPEAR TO HAVE THE UPPER
HAND. CERTAINLY THEY ARE THE DOMINANT FORCE IN
THE MAJLIS. BUT IN AN IRAN WHERE NOBODY SEEMS
TO AGREE ON THE POLITICAL RULES, DO THE ACTIVISTS
SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT THE NATIONALISTS HAVE BEEN
VANQUISHED? THE FATE OF THE HOSTAGES HANGS ON
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION, FOR IF THE INTERFAC-
TIONAL STRUGGLE PERSISTS, THE ACTIVISTS WILL BE
RELUCTANT TO FREE THEIR AMERICAN PRIZES.
IT MAY APPEAR TO BE A FRUSTRATING GAME FOR
THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS BEEN HUMILIATED AT
EVERY TURN IN ITS DEALINGS WITH POST-PAHLAVI IRAN.
BUT IT IS NO GAME IN TEHERAN. AT THIS TIME OF
OPTIMISM, WHEN HOPE FOR THE HOSTAGES HAS NOT
BEEN GREATER, IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO RULE OUT
THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER UNPLEASANT SURPRISE.
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
THE GRAFFITI WALL AT MELBOURNE'S CITY SQUARE
IS MORE THAN A NOVEL FEATURE OF THE OVERALL
ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN. IT ALSO PROVIDES A LEGITIMATE
MEDIUM FOR PEOPLE'S PROPENSITY TO INSCRIBE THEIR
NAMES AND SET FORTH THEIR SENTIMENTS IN PUBLIC
PLACES.
THE URGE TO WRITE ONE'S NAME BEGINS AS SOON
AS A CHILD LEARNS TO SPELL. IT IS ONE OF THE FIRST
EXPRESSIONS OF THE INNATE HUMAN DESIRE TO LEAVE
ONE'S MARK ON THE WORLD. IT GIVES A CHILD A SENSE
OF IDENTITY TO KNIFE HIS NAME IN A CLASSROOM DESK
OR, AS PHILLIP ADAMS SAYS HE DID, SCRATCH IT IN
THE PAINT OF A SHELTER-SHED WALL.
SUCH PRANKS ARE TYPICAL OF CHILDREN. BUT THE
INCLINATION OF ADULTS TO SCRIBBLE THEIR NAMES ON
A PARK SEAT OR A STATION WALL BETRAYS A PERSISTING
STREAK OF JUVENILITY, OR OF INFERIORITY FEELINGS
THEY MAY YET OUTGROW ON DISCOVERING SOCIALLY
USEFUL MEANS OF ACHIEVING DISTINCTION. WE MAY
SUPPOSE THAT PHILLIP ADAMS FELT NO DESIRE TO
AGAIN DEFACE GOVERNMENT PROPERTY AFTER HIS
NAME AND TALENTS BECAME HOUSEHOLD WORDS.
AS CHILDHOOD RECEDES AND A SOCIAL
AWARENESS GROWS, GRAFFITI OFFERS PEOPLE A
TEMPTING METHOD OF REGISTERING PROTEST, URGING
REFORMS, CASTIGATING POLITCIANS AND PROMOTING
CAUSES. ALTHOUGH THE ISSUES THEY ADVOCATE ARE
CONTEMPORARY, THE MEANS THEY EMPLOY ARE
ANCIENT. WHEN EXCAVATORS SHOVELLED AWAY THE
PUMICE AND ASH FROM THE RUINS OF POMPEII, THEY
CONFRONTED, SCRAWLED ON STREET WALLS, CRUDE
NOTICES SUCH AS, IN LATIN, "VOTE FOR C. JULIUS
POLYBIUS. HE STANDS FOR GOOD BREAD".
SOME PRESENT-AGE SLOGANS ALSO OUTLAST THE
CAMPAIGNS THAT EVOKED THEM. DATED DEMANDS
LIKE, "OUT MENZIES", "NO CONSCRIPTS", AND
"YANKS GO HOME", STILL LINGER FAINTLY ON RAILWAY
BRIDGES AND OLD FENCES.
THE PAINT BRUSH OF THE WAR YEARS HAS BEEN
SUPERSEDED BY TODAY'S SPRAY CAN TO BLAZON
CURRENT WATCHWORDS LIKE, "NO YANKEE BASES FOR
AUSTRALIA", "LEAVE URANIUM IN THE GROUND", OR
QUESTIONS LIKE, "WHO ELECTED GALLAGHER?"
OTHER GRAFFITI IS UNDATED; IT WILL BE RELEVANT
LONG AFTER THE MEANING OF SOME TOPICAL
INSCRIPTION IS FORGOTTEN. ARTHUR KOESTLER TELLS
OF A JEW INCARCERATED IN A NAZI PRISON DURING
WORLD WAR II. HE DID NOT WRITE HIS NAME, BUT
HE CONFESSED HIS FAITH. SCRATCHED IN THE PAINT
OF THE WALL WAS:
I BELIEVE IN THE SUN, EVEN WHEN IT IS NOT SHINING.
I BELIEVE IN LOVE, EVEN WHEN I DO NOT FEEL IT.
I BELIEVE IN GOD, EVEN WHEN HE IS SILENT.
NEARER HOME, AND MORE RECENTLY, UNTIL HE
DIED IN 1967, ARTHUR STACEY, A CONVERTED
ALCOHOLIC IN SYDNEY, BECAME WIDELY KNOWN
DURING THE THIRTY YEARS HE DAILY CHALKED THE
SINGLE WORD ETERNITY ON THE CITY'S FOOTPATHS.
BY CONTRAST, SOME GRAFFITISTS GO FOR MORE
EARTHY THEMES. APPARENTLY POSSESSING NO HIGH
AMBITION, THEY DISFIGURE PUBLIC TOILETS WITH THEIR
SEXY SKETCHES AND SALACIOUS SENTIMENTS.
AS FOR THE CITY SQUARE, THE CIVIC FATHERS
PREFER THAT PEOPLE SCRIBBLE THEIR NAMES, DISPLAY
THEIR WIT, AVOW THEIR LOVE AND EXTERIORISE THEIR
HANG-UPS ON A WASHABLE WALL THAN ON THE NEW
MASONRY OR - SPARE THE THOUGHT - THE INVITING
WALLS OF THE ROBERTSON-SWANN SCULPTURE.

MONDAY 27 OCTOBER 1980
"THE WAGE INDEXATION CRISIS"
EVEN AFTER ALLOWING FOR ALL THE TUMULT AND
BLUFF WITH WHICH INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ARE
CONDUCTED IN AUSTRALIA, IT DOES SEEM THAT
WAGE INDEXATION IS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE.
THIS IS DISTURBING. FOR ALL ITS LIMITATIONS AND
IMPERFECTIONS, INDEXATION IS PREFERABLE TO THE
ALTERNATIVES. NO LESS OMINOUS IS THE UNDERLYING
BREAKDOWN IN CONSENSUS AND RESTRAINT, SIGNALLING
A STORMY OUTLOOK FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. BUT GIVEN THE TRADITIONAL
CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS AMONG EMPLOYERS, UNIONS
AND GOVERNMENTS, AND THE DAUNTING PRESSURES
ON THE ARBITRATION SYSTEM, PERHAPS THE WONDER
IS THAT WAGE INDEXATION HAS SURVIVED AS LONG
AS IT HAS.
THE ARBITRATION COMMISSION INTRODUCED THE
CONCEPT OF WAGE INDEXATION IN APRIL 1975. IT
FOLLOWED A PERIOD OF STEEP PAY INCREASES, SHARPLY
RISING INFLATION AND A SLUMP IN BUSINESS
PROFITABILITY AND EMPLOYMENT. THE IDEA WAS TO
MODERATE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES BY REGULARLY
COMPENSATING WAGE EARNERS FOR RISES IN THE COST
OF LIVING, AND TO DO SO ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS.
THE HOPE WAS ALSO THAT THIS ORDERLY SYSTEM OF
WAGE FIXATION WOULD IMPROVE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.
THE WHOLE FRAGILE PACKAGE DEPENDED ON WHAT THE
COMMISSION TERMED "SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE".
THIS MEANT THAT EXCEPT FOR SPECIAL PROVISION FOR
PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES, WORK VALUE CHANGES AND
REMEDY OF ANOMALIES, THERE WERE TO BE NO
PRESSURES FOR WAGE RISES OUTSIDE THE REGULAR
ADJUSTMENTS AND THESE GUIDELINES.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN LESS
THAN ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT INDEXATION AND HAS
REPEATEDLY, BUT ONLY WITH PARTIAL SUCCESS,
PRESSED THE COMMISSION TO DISCOUNT INDEXATION
FOR PRICE INCREASES DUE TO GOVERNMENT TAXES AND
CHARGES. BUT THE THREAT TO THE FUTURE OF
INDEXATION HAS COME FROM THE EROSION OF
"SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE" BY THE UNIONS, TO SOME
DEGREE WITH COLLUSION (UNDER DURESS) BY
EMPLOYERS. WHILE THE ACTU COMMITTED ITSELF
TO THE CONCEPT OF ORDERLY, CENTRALISED WAGE
FIXING, MILITANT AND POWERFUL UNIONS HAVE SOUGHT
TO POCKET THE BENEFITS OF INDEXATION AND USE
INDUSTRIAL ACTION TO PRESS FOR ADDITIONAL PAY
RISES AS WELL. THIS WAS PARTLY BECAUSE INDEXATION
DID NOT FULLY COMPENSATE WORKERS FOR HIGHER
LIVING COSTS AND PARTLY BECAUSE SOME UNIONS
REFUSED TO BE RESTRAINED BY THE INDEXATION
GUIDELINES. A SUCCESSION OF GENUINE AND PHONEY
WORK VALUE CASES HAS SEVERELY STRAINED THE
GUIDELINES AND WIDENED THE GAP BETWEEN THE
STRONGER AND WEAKER UNIONS.
THE CAMPAIGN BY METAL WORKERS FOR A 35-
HOUR WEEK, AND THEIR REFUSAL TO SUSPEND THEIR
PROGRAMME OF MONTHLY FIVE-HOUR STOPPAGES IN
SUPPORT OF IT, NOW HAS THREATENED TO DESTROY
INDEXATION. THE ARBITRATION COMMISSION WARNED
ON THURSDAY THAT THE NEXT NATIONAL WAGE CASE
WOULD BE ADJOURNED INDEFINITELY UNLESS
DISLOCATION OF INDUSTRY LESSENED. HAVING FAILED
TO PERSUADE THE METAL TRADES UNIONS TO DEFER
THEIR CAMPAIGN, THE ACTU RESPONDED BY SAYING
THAT ANY DELAY IN THE CASE - IN WHICH IT WILL
SEEK A 4.7 PER CENT PAY INCREASE FOR ALL WAGE
EARNERS - COULD FORCE IT TO WITHDRAW ITS
SUPPORT OF INDEXATION. THE UNIONS ARGUE THAT
THE NATIONAL WAGE CASE SHOULD BE KEPT DISTINCT
FROM A CAMPAIGN FOR SHORTER WORKING HOURS.
BUT THE COMMISSION HAS TAKEN THE VIEW THAT THE
LEVEL OF INDUSTRIAL DISRUPTION HAS EXCEEDED
TOLERABLE LIMITS. UNFORTUNATELY, EVEN IF THE
ACTU WISHED TO DIMINISH INDUSTRIAL ACTION IN
SUPPORT OF A 35-HOUR WEEK, IT LACKS THE POWER
OVER INDIVIDUAL UNIONS TO DO SO. THE PROSPECT OF
A RETURN TO "SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE" WITH THE
GUIDELINES SEEMS REMOTE.
THIS LEADS TO THE DAUNTING QUESTION: IF
INDEXATION BREAKS DOWN, WHAT WILL TAKE ITS
PLACE? SOME UNIONS, AND SOME EMPLOYERS,
WOULD PREFER TO BYPASS THE ARBITRATION
MACHINERY ALTOGETHER AND RELY ON AMERICAN-
STYLE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. BUT WHILE INDEXATION
MAY GO, THE ARBITRATION SYSTEM WILL REMAIN,
ALTHOUGH ITS EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE MUCH REDUCED.
THERE WOULD BE A RETURN TO PRE-INDEXATION DAYS,
WHEN INDIVIDUAL UNIONS PURSUED CLAIMS WITH
LITTLE REGARD FOR COMMUNITY INTERESTS BUT WHEN
THE ECONOMY'S CAPACITY TO PAY WAS A MAJOR
CONSIDERATION IN NATIONAL WAGE ADJUSTMENTS.
THE RESULT WOULD PROBABLY BE THAT THE STRONGER
UNIONS WOULD BE ABLE TO WIN SUBSTANTIAL AND
INFLATIONARY WAGE INCREASES AND THAT MEMBERS
OF WEAKER UNIONS WOULD FALL BEHIND IN THEIR
RELATIVE PURCHASING POWER. THE SQUEEZE ON
EMPLOYERS WOULD ADD TO THE TOLL OF
UNEMPLOYMENT. IN SHORT, THE COLLAPSE OF WAGE
INDEXATION WOULD TEND TO INCREASE INDUSTRIAL
STRIFE, THREATEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND
WEAKEN SOCIAL EQUITY.
ANOTHER CASUALTY WOULD BE THE AUTHORITY
AND INFLUENCE OF THE ARBITRATION COMMISSION
ITSELF. THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN FORCED TO
MAINTAIN AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BALANCE BETWEEN
ITS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO SETTLE
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES AND THE GOVERNMENT'S
ATTEMPT TO USE IT AS AN INSTRUMENT OF ECONOMIC
POLICY. WHENEVER IT FAILS TO CURB INFLATIONARY
WAGE SETTLEMENTS TO THE GOVERNMENT'S
SATISFACTION, IT BECOMES A CONVENIENT SCAPEGOAT
FOR SHORTCOMINGS IN THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC
MANAGEMENT. IF THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THE
CONTROL OF WAGES IS ESSENTIAL TO HOLD DOWN
INFLATION AND PROMOTE ECONOMIC RECOVERY, THEN
IT MAY HAVE TO SEEK THE NECESSARY CONSTITUTIONAL
POWERS TO EXERCISE SUCH CONTROL DIRECTLY. THE
POLITICAL OBSTACLES OF SUCH A COURSE, WHETHER
BY WAY OF POPULAR REFERENDUM OR BY TRYING TO
PERSUADE THE STATES TO REFER THEIR POWERS TO THE
COMMONWEALTH, ARE FORMIDABLE. IT WOULD BE
BETTER IF, EVEN AT THIS CRITICAL STAGE, INDEXATION
COULD BE MAINTAINED. THAT WOULD REQUIRE A
GREATER WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE AND TO PUT
COMMUNITY INTERESTS FIRST THAN THE PARTIES TO
THE NATIONAL WAGE CASE HAVE YET SHOWN.

TUESDAY 28 OCTOBER 1980
"THE NSW JAIL CRISIS"
THE WRAN GOVERNMENT IS ADEPT AT POLITICAL
COMPROMISES. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IT
HAS MANAGED TO DEFUSE TOUCHY ISSUES WITH
ACCEPTABLE, AND AT TIMES REFRESHING,
COMPROMISES. BUT LAST WEEK'S DECISION TO TAKE
ACTION AGAINST TWO PRISON OFFICERS WILL SERVE ONLY
TO COMPROMISE THE GOVERNMENT. THE
GOVERNMENT HAS THROWN THE NSW PENAL SYSTEM
INTO CHAOS BY ITS BELATED AND WEAK DECISION,
WHICH HAS PROVED UNACCEPTABLE TO PRISON
OFFICERS, PRISONERS AND THE PUBLIC.
TWO-AND-A-HALF YEARS AGO, JUSTICE NAGLE
COMPLETED HIS INQUIRY INTO NSW PRISONS FROM
1943 TO 1976, AND FOUND "A REGIME WHICH HAS
NOW BEEN REVEALED IN ALL ITS HORROR AND
BRUTALITY". HIGHLIGHTING THE "BRUTAL, SAVAGE AND
SOMETIMES SADISTIC PHYSICAL VIOLENCE" IN SOME
PRISONS, THE JUDGE CRITICISED ABOUT 30 WARDERS
IN A NUMBER OF JAILS.
DESPITE THE DAMNING EVIDENCE, THE NAGLE
REPORT WAS FILED AWAY WHILE PERIPHERAL INQUIRIES
WERE STARTED INTO PRISON OFFICERS AND THE
BATHURST RIOTS OF 1974. DURING THIS TIME, THE
WRAN GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO AVOID ANY
DECISION ON AN EXPLOSIVE ISSUE.
BUT THE DELAY HAS SERVED ONLY TO MAKE THE
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION MORE DIFFICULT, BECAUSE
DURING THAT TIME THE PENAL SYSTEM WHICH
JUSTICE NAGLE FOUND ABHORRENT HAS IMPROVED.
THE BRUTALITY AND INDIFFERENCE IN THE OLD SYSTEM
HAS BEEN REPLACED BY A MORE CIVILISED AND
COMPASSIONATE ATTITUDE.
LAST WEEK THE GOVERNMENT WAS FACED WITH
TWO UNPALATABLE CHOICES: PROSECUTE ALL  THE
OFFICERS CRITICISED IN THE REPORT DESPITE THE FACT
THAT JAILS, AND PRESUMABLY THEIR OFFICERS, HAD
REFORMED: OR IGNORE PAST INJUSTICES AND PROSECUTE
NONE. MR WRAN'S GOVERNMENT KNEW THAT ANY
ACTION TAKEN AGAINST A PRISON OFFICER WOULD INCITE
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES. IT WAS EQUALLY AWARE THAT
A FAILURE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE OFFICERS WOULD
BE REGARDED AS UNJUST BY PRISONERS AND BY SOME
OF THE PUBLIC.
IN TAKING DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST TWO
OF THE 30 OFFICERS NAMED IN THE REPORT, THE
GOVERNMENT ADMITTED THAT INJUSTICES HAD BEEN
COMMITTED. BUT, BY ITS FAILURE TO PROSECUTE, THE
GOVERNMENT SHOWED ITSELF UNWILLING TO SUBJECT
THE OFFICERS TO THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW. THE
UGLY SCENES IN NSW JAILS OVER THE PAST FEW
DAYS HAVE PROVED THAT THE COMPROMISE HAS
PLEASED NO ONE. PRISON OFFICERS WANT THE
GOVERNMENT TO IGNORE THE NAGLE REPORT, WHILE
PRISONERS WANT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS ACTED ON.
THE PREMIER, MR WRAN, HAS SAID HE WILL
NOT CHANGE THE DECISION. HE THINKS THE ISSUE
WILL DIE DOWN. BUT WHILE THE CONTROVERSY RAGES,
HE MIGHT WELL REFLECT THAT AN UNCOMPROMISED
STANCE, NO MATTER HOW POLITICALLY DANGEROUS,
WOULD HAVE BEEN WISER IN THE LONG RUN.
"CANADA AND ITS CONSTITUTION"
ON THE FACE OF IT, CANADA'S CONSTIUTIONAL
PROBLEM SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH. WHAT SERVES
AS THE COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTION IS, IN FACT, A
BRITISH ACT OF PARLIAMENT, A 113-YEAR-OLD LEGACY
OF COLONIAL RULE. SINCE IT IS A BRITISH LAW, THE
CONSTITUTION CAN BE AMENDED ONLY BY THE
BRITISH PARLIAMENT. ALTHOUGH NO BRITISH
PARLIAMENT EVER AMENDS THE ACT EXCEPT AT THE
REQUEST OF THE CANADIAN AUTHORITIES, IT WOULD
SEEM TO BE AN INTOLERABLE STATE OF AFFAIRS FOR AN
INDEPENDENT NATION. INDEED, WESTMINSTER IS AS
ANXIOUS TO "PATRIATE" THE ACT AS MR TRUDEAU,
THE CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER. WHAT, THEN, IS THE
PROBLEM? MOST OF CANADA'S 10 PROVINCES DO NOT
WANT THE POWER OF THE ACT TRANSFERRED TO OTTAWA
UNLESS THERE IS PRIOR AGREEMENT ON A FORMULA FOR
AMENDING IT. AND TO AGREE ON ITS AMENDMENT,
THE COUNTRY'S 11 GOVERNMENTS FIRST HAVE TO
DECIDE HOW THEIR POWERS SHOULD BE SHARED.
THERE IS CERTAINLY NO AGREEMENT HERE, WHICH
IS WHY A DOZEN PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS AT
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM HAVE FAILED. MR TRUDEAU
WANTS TO INSERT A BILL OF RIGHTS IN THE
CONSTITUTION AND GUARANTEE EVERY CANADIAN THE
RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION AND TO GOVERNMENT
SERVICES IN EITHER FRENCH OR ENGLISH. HE INSISTS
THAT ONLY THESE LANGUAGE RIGHTS WOULD FULFIL HIS
PROMISE TO QUEBEC THAT HE WOULD CHANGE THE
CONSTITUTION TO THE PROVINCE'S BENEFIT IF IT
REJECTED SEPARATISM IN THE QUEBEC REFERENDUM
EARLIER THIS YEAR, WHICH IT DID. MR TRUDEAU FEELS
THAT THE FEDERATION CAN WORK ONLY IF FRENCH
CANADIANS DO NOT FEEL CONFINED TO QUEBEC,
WHICH IS WHY HE HAS PUSHED SO STRONGLY FOR THE
CONSTITUTIONAL BILL OF RIGHTS. HE BELIEVES THAT
CANADA IS DANGEROUSLY DECENTRALISED AND THAT
THE PROVINCES ENJOY FAR TOO MUCH POWER. THE
PREMIERS DISAGREE. WITH THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION
OF MR DAVIS OF ONTARIO, MOST OF THEM ARGUE THAT
IT IS OTTAWA THAT HAS TOO MUCH POWER AND THAT
THE COUNTRY WOULD BENEFIT IF THE PROVINCES
BECAME EVEN STRONGER.
BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT CLAIM TO REFLECT
THE WILL OF THE CANADIAN PEOPLE. SO WHOM ARE
WE TO BELIEVE? SOME OF THE PROVINCIAL
GOVERNMENTS CERTAINLY HAVE VESTED INTERESTS TO
PURSUE. ALBERTA, FOR EXAMPLE, IS AWASH WITH OIL
REVENUE AND FEARS THAT OTTAWA WILL USE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM TO DILUTE THE PROVINCE'S
PROSPERITY. NEWFOUNDLAND, IN MUCH THE SAME
WAY, CLAIMS OWNERSHIP OF ALL ITS OFF-SHORE
RESOURCES, INCLUDING OIL, WHERE IN OTHER
FEDERATIONS, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, THEY WOULD FALL
UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT. AS IT IS, MR TRUDEAU PLANS TO
IMPOSE BIG ENERGY TAXES DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT
THE POORER PROVINCES IN THE EAST WILL SHARE THE
ENORMOUS WEALTH OF THE WEST. HE ALSO PROPOSES
TO ELIMINATE THE BARRIERS MANY PROVINCES HAVE
SET UP AGAINST GOODS, WORKERS AND CAPITAL FROM
OTHER PROVINCES.
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS NOW WON A
PRELIMINARY PARLIAMENTARY VICTORY FOR HIS
PROGRAMME TO BRING THE CONSTITUTION
HOME FROM BRITAIN WITH A BILL OF RIGHTS.
THE PROGRAMME WILL GO TO THE UPPER
HOUSE WHERE IT IS LIKELY TO BE APPROVED. MR
TRUDEAU WANTS TO ASK WESTMINSTER TO ACT IN
TIME FOR A CEREMONIAL "PATRIATION" ON 1 JULY,
CANADA'S NATIONAL DAY. EVEN WITH THE NECESSARY
MAJORITIES IN THE OTTAWA PARLIAMENT, HOWEVER,
IT WOULD NOT BE EASY FOR LONDON TO COMPLY WITH
THE PRIME MINISTER'S REQUEST WITHOUT AGREEMENT
FROM THE PROVINCES. WESTMINSTER WOULD BE
FACED WITH A CHOICE OF PLEASING OTTAWA AND
DISPLEASING THE PROVINCIAL CAPITALS, OR OF BEING
SEEN TO REJECT A REQUEST FOR CONSTITUTIONAL
INDEPENDENCE, THUS BEING DRAGGED DIRECTLY INTO
CANADA'S CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROVERSY. THE FACT
THAT MR TRUDEAU IS USING THE "PATRIATION"
REQUEST TO TRY TO FORCE AGREEMENT ON A
CONSTITUTIONAL FORMULA MEANS THAT THE BITTERNESS
AND DIVISION IN CANADA WILL WORSEN.
THE PRIME MINISTER'S CUMBERSOME ANSWER
IS TO RID OTTAWA OF WESTMINSTER, FREEZE THE
"PATRIATED" CONSTITUTION FOR TWO YEARS AND THEN,
IF UNANIMOUS PROVINCIAL AGREEMENT ELUDES HIM,
GO TO THE NATION IN A REFERENDUM. THE CHOICE
WOULD BE BETWEEN MR TRUDEAU'S FORMULA AND A
FORMULA DESIGNED BY A MAJORITY OF THE
PROVINCES. PERHAPS A BETTER IDEA WOULD BE TO GO
TO THE NATION NOW. WHAT IS TO BE GAINED BY
BRINGING HOME THE CONSTITUTION BEFORE
AGREEMENT ON WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH IT?
CANADA HAS ALWAYS BEEN AMBIVALENT ABOUT ITS
IDENTITY. IT CANNOT POSTPONE FOR MUCH LONGER
THE CHOICE BETWEEN PROVINCIALISM AND
FEDERALISM.
<F33>
WEDNESDAY 29 OCTOBER 1980
"VICTORIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS"
MUCH OF THE GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN OUR LIVING
STANDARDS THIS CENTURY HAS BEEN DUE TO THE
SPREAD OF ELECTRICITY. IF WE RARELY THINK ABOUT
THIS, IT IS BECAUSE ELECTRICITY HAS BECOME SO
PERVASIVE IN OUR LIVES - LIGHTING, HEATING,
TELEVISION, RADIO, RECORD PLAYERS, APPLIANCES -
THAT WE HAVE COME TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.
WITH EACH DECADE IT HAS BECOME CHEAPER AND
MORE PLENTIFUL, AND WE NATURALLY ASSUME THAT
IT WILL GO ON DOING SO.
UNFORTUNATELY FOR VICTORIA, IT MAY NOT.
AGAINST THE TREND OF THE REST OF THE WORLD, AND
OF OUR OWN PAST EXPERIENCE, OUR ELECTRICITY LOOKS
LIKE BECOMING MORE EXPENSIVE FROM HERE ON
- AND POSSIBLY EVEN SCARCE. WHY? BECAUSE
DESPITE OUR VAST WEALTH OF BROWN COAL, OUR
TECHNICAL SKILLS AND CAPITAL RESOURCES, THIS STATE
HAS BECOME UNABLE TO BUILD NEW POWER STATIONS
WITHIN A TIMETABLE AND A PRICE RANGE THAT
DELIVERS CHEAPER ELECTRICITY. AND UNLESS THE
STRIKES THAT HAVE HALTED WORK ON THE LOY YANG
AND YALLOURN W POWER STATIONS CAN BE SETTLED
SOON - AND SETTLED FOR GOOD - THERE IS A REAL
RISK THAT WE WILL ALSO FACE REGULAR ELECTRICITY
SHORTAGES AND BLACKOUTS WITHIN TWO OR THREE
YEARS.
VICTORIA'S ELECTRICITY SYSTEM IS HEADING FOR
A CRISIS THAT HAS CAUGHT MOST OF US UNAWARES.
THE SEEDS OF IT WERE SOWN BY THE NEWPORT
POWER STATION DISPUTE. WHATEVER THE RIGHTS AND
WRONGS OF IT, THE LONG DELAY IN THE NEWPORT
PROJECT AND THE CHANGES FINALLY MADE TO IT WILL
PROVE EXPENSIVE FOR ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS.
POWER FROM THE 500 MEGAWATT (MILLION WATT)
NEWPORT STATION JUST COMPLETED WILL COST MORE
THAN POWER FROM A 1000 MEGAWATT STATION
COMPLETED IN 1977, AS PLANNED. POWER FROM THE
SIX SMALLER GAS TURBINES INSTALLED IN THE LATROBE
VALLEY AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE OTHER HALF OF
NEWPORT IS COSTING US FAR MORE AGAIN. SO ARE
THE OLD OIL-FIRED METROPOLITAN POWER STATIONS
WHICH HAVE BEEN KEPT OPERATING TO KEEP VICTORIA
GOING WHILE NEWPORT WAS BEING BUILT.
SO FAR VICTORIAN CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN
SHIELDED FROM THESE UGLY FACTS BECAUSE THE SEC
HAS USED ALL POSSIBLE MEANS TO HOLD ITS CHARGES
DOWN. THIS STEMS LESS FROM A HUMANITARIAN
OUTLOOK AT THE TOP OF MONASH HOUSE THAN FROM
THE FIERCE, COMPETITIVE WAR BEING WAGED BETWEEN
ELECTRICITY AND GAS FOR THE HOME HEATING, WATER
HEATING AND COOKING MARKETS. INSTEAD OF RAISING
ITS CHARGES, THE SEC HAS DRAWN HEAVILY ON
TRADE CREDITORS, RUN DOWN ITS FINANCIAL ASSETS
SO MUCH THAT IT IS NOW $20 MILLION IN THE RED,
AND TAKEN TO FINANCING VIRTUALLY ITS ENTIRE
CAPITAL WORKS PROGRAMME FROM DOMESTIC AND
OVERSEAS LOANS. BUT ALL THESE TECHNIQUES ONLY
DEFER THE CRUNCH, AND IT IS NOW ABOUT TO HIT US.
THE 14.6 PER CENT INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY CHARGES
FROM 17 NOVEMBER WILL PROBABLY BE THE FIRST
OF A SERIES OF RISES WHICH WILL MAKE ELECTRICITY
MORE EXPENSIVE FOR VICTORIANS IN THE 1980S.
THE NEWPORT CLOUD AT LEAST HAS A SILVER
LINING. BECAUSE OF THE TRADES HALL COUNCIL BAN
ON THE PROJECT, THE BUILDING UNIONS' ORGANISERS
KEPT OFF THE SITE. AS A RESULT, ONCE WORK FINALLY
STARTED, THE STATION WAS COMPLETED ALMOST ON
TIME. BUT WE HAVE HAD NO SUCH LUCK AT THE TWO
GIANT POWER STATIONS NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION
IN THE LATROBE VALLEY. THE TWO FINAL UNITS OF
THE YALLOURN W STATION, WHICH WILL GENERATE
750 MEGAWATTS BETWEEN THEM, ARE NOW TWO
YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE OWING TO A SUCCESSION OF
PETTY INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES. WORSE STILL, THE FIRST
STAGE OF THE VAST LOY YANG STATION, TO PRODUCE
2000 MEGAWATTS OF POWER, IS A FULL YEAR BEHIND
SCHEDULE ALREADY, AND HAS BEEN AT A VIRTUAL
STANDSTILL FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS. EVEN IF
THE WORKERS WENT BACK TOMORROW AND THERE
WERE NO FURTHER DELAYS, LOY YANG WOULD BE
UNABLE TO PRODUCE ANY ELECTRICITY UNTIL 1984.
THERE IS NOT SPACE HERE TO UNRAVEL THE
COMPLICATED TANGLE OF INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES THAT
HAS BROUGHT LOY YANG TO A HALT - AND HAS NOW
SPREAD TO ENGULF YALLOURN W AS WELL. THE MOST
DESTRUCTIVE OF ALL HAS BEEN A MINOR DISPUTE OVER
A $6.90 A WEEK WORK VALUE CLAIM BY CONCRETE
BATCHERS WHICH HAS SNOWBALLED TO SHUT DOWN
ALMOST THE ENTIRE PROJECT - AND KEEP IT SHUT
APPARENTLY INDEFINITELY. TO THIS CAN BE ADDED A
CLAIM FOR $6000 EACH BY THE WORKERS STOOD
DOWN, CLAIMS BY VARIOUS UNIONS SEEKING BENEFITS
WON BY OTHERS - OR SEEKING TO PRESERVE THEIR
TRADITIONAL MARGINS OVER OTHERS - AND A SERIES
OF DEMARCATION DISPUTES BETWEEN THE UNIONS ON
SITE.
THE MOST DISTURBING THING OF ALL IS THE
APPARENT LACK OF WILL TO GET THE DISPUTE RESOLVED.
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HAVE DRAGGED
ON FOR TWO MONTHS IN THE ARBITRATION
COMMISSION WITHOUT A SETTLEMENT COMING INTO
SIGHT. INDUSTRIAL OBSERVERS BELIEVE THE DISPUTES
ARE UNLIKELY TO BE RESOLVED THIS YEAR, AND MAY
NOT LEAD TO ANY LASTING PEACE IN ANY CASE. THE
BLAME FOR THIS IS WIDESPREAD: SOME ACTIONS BY
THE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN PROVOCATIVE, AND THE
TRADE UNION MOVEMENT AS A WHOLE HAS DONE
NOTHING TO HELP GET THE DISPUTE SETTLED. BUT THE
MAIN SINGLE BARRIER TO A SETTLEMENT APPEARS TO
BE THE UNCOMPROMISING ATTUTIDE OF THE UNION AT
THE CENTRE OF MOST OF THE DISPUTES - THE
BUILDERS LABORERS FEDERATION, LED BY MR NORM
GALLAGHER. NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME, MR GALLAGHER'S
APPROACH TO A SETTLEMENT APPEARS TO BE THAT ALL
THE CONCESSIONS MUST COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE
- AND THAT HE IS PREPARED TO WAIT INDEFINITELY
UNTIL THEY DO. A RECENT SETTLEMENT OFFER WAS
REJECTED BY MR GALLAGHER WITH THE PROPHETIC
WORDS: "THE PEOPLE OF VICTORIA HAD BETTER START
BUYING CANDLES AND HURRICANE LAMPS".
AND WELL WE MIGHT. MR GALLAGHER IS QUITE
RIGHT IN NOTING THAT THE MAIN VICTIMS OF THE
LOY YANG DISPUTE WILL BE THE ORDINARY PEOPLE
OF VICTORIA. EACH DAY THE COST OF LOY YANG RISES
BY $1 MILLION, AND IT IS THE ORDINARY PEOPLE,
VICTORIA'S ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS, WHO WILL HAVE
TO PAY IT. IF WORK AT LOY YANG AND YALLOURN W
DOES NOT RE-START SOON, THERE WILL INEVITABLY
BE BLACKOUTS IN VICTORIA, AND EVERY HOME, SHOP,
FACTORY AND OFFICE CAN EXPECT ITS SHARE. NONE OF
THE INDIVIDUAL PRINCIPLES HELD DEAR BY THE VARIOUS
PARTICIPANTS IN THE DISPUTES JUSTIFIES THE PROBLEMS
THEY ARE BUILDING UP FOR THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE.
EVERYONE INVOLVED SHOULD BE PREPARED TO GIVE A
LITTLE TO TRY TO GET THE DISPUTES RESOLVED SOON,
AND IN A MANNER THAT WILL SECURE A LASTING
SETTLEMENT. THEY MUST PUT THE PEOPLE FIRST.
THE STATE GOVERNMENT, FOR ITS PART, SHOULD
TAKE STOCK OF THE PROBLEMS LOOMING OVER THE
SEC. THESE ARE NOT CONFINED TO LOY YANG, AND
NEITHER ARE THE SOLUTIONS TO THEM. THE SEC FACES
A HUGE INTEREST AND REPAYMENTS BILL OVER THE
NEXT 10 YEARS, A NEED FOR CAPITAL WHICH THE LOAN
MARKET MAY NOT MEET, AND ALL THAT TIME IT WILL
BE RELYING HEAVILY ON RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE GAS
TURBINE GENERATORS. THE HAMER GOVERNMENT
COULD HELP BY HALTING THE FUTILE COMPETITION
BETWEEN ITS GAS AND ELECTRICITY AGENCIES FOR THE
DOMESTIC MARKET. IN THE INTERESTS OF ENERGY
CONSERVATION AND ECONOMICS ALIKE, IT WOULD
MAKE SENSE TO RESERVE COOKING AND HOME HEATING
AS FIELDS FOR GAS, AND HOT WATER HEATING FOR
ELECTRICITY (COUPLED WITH SOLAR ENERGY). THE
GOVERNMENT MIGHT ALSO CONSIDER WITHDRAWING
ITS TURNOVER TAX ON ELECTRICITY SALES TO RELIEVE
THE IMPACT OF FUTURE ELECTRICITY PRICE RISES. IT
SHOULD ALSO RECONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES OF SHIFTING
THE SEC'S HEAD OFFICE TO THE LATROBE VALLEY IN
THE INTERESTS OF BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.
FINALLY, IT SHOULD RENEGOTIATE ITS AGREEMENT WITH
ALCOA REGARDING THE PORTLAND ALUMINIUM SMELTER
- AN AGREEMENT THAT IS LOOKING MORE
INAPPROPRIATE EVERY DAY AS THE SEC SINKS DEEPER
INTO FINANCIAL TROUBLE AND FUTURE SUPPLIES LOOK
MORE UNCERTAIN.

THURSDAY 30 OCTOBER 1980
"TIME RUNS OUT IN NAMIBIA"
A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN ZIMBABWE HAS
CLEARED THE GROUND FOR WHAT IS BEING CALLED
THE LAST BATTLE BUT ONE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. THE
BATTLE FOR NAMIBIA, IN FACT, HAS BEEN RUNNING
FOR 14 YEARS. THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN RULED BY
SOUTH AFRICA SINCE 1920, ALTHOUGH THE MANDATE
WAS REVOKED BY THE UNITED NATIONS A DECADE
AGO. SOUTH AFRICA HAS STAYED ON ILLEGALLY,
SPENDING NEARLY $1 MILLION A DAY ON ITS WAR
WITH THE SOUTH WEST AFRICAN PEOPLE'S
ORGANISATION, WHICH IS BASED IN ANGOLA,
SUPPORTED BY THE SOVIET BLOC, LED BY A MARXIST,
AND THUS ANATHEMA TO PRETORIA. THE SOUTH
AFRICAN GOVERNMENT ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE MORE
THAN TWO YEARS AGO A UNITED NATIONS PLAN FOR
NAMIBIA. THERE WOULD BE A CEASEFIRE MONITORED
BY 7500 UNITED NATIONS TROOPS, AND A UNITED
NATIONS SPONSORED GENERAL ELECTION LEADING TO
LEGAL INDEPENDENCE.
PRETORIA'S PROBLEM IS THAT IT KNOWS SWAPO
COULD WELL WIN SUCH AN ELECTION, WITH OR
WITHOUT INTIMIDATION. SO IT HAS USED EVERY
EXCUSE TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSALS
WORKED OUT BY THE FIVE WESTERN POWERS IN THE
SECURITY COUNCIL. AND THE DELAY HAS BEEN USED
TO SET UP A MULTI-RACIAL ASSEMBLY TO SOUTH
AFRICA'S LIKING. THE ASSEMBLY, NOW VESTED WITH
EXECUTIVE AS WELL AS LEGISLATIVE POWERS, IS
CONTROLLED BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT'S
FAVORITE PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC TURNHALLE
ALLIANCE. ALL THIS ACTIVITY IN WINDHOEK,
NAMIBIA'S CAPITAL, HAS AROUSED SUSPICION THAT
PRETORIA IS HOLDING THE UNITED NATIONS AT BAY
IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE DTA TO DEVELOP INTERNAL
POPULARITY AND LEGITIMACY IN THE EYES OF THE
OUTSIDE WORLD.
WHAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT WILL
NOT ADMIT IN PUBLIC IS THAT THERE CAN BE NO
REALISTIC, LASTING OR PEACEFUL AGREEMENT IN
NAMIBIA WITHOUT POLITICAL PARTICIPATION BY
SWAPO. WHILE THE DIEHARDS OF PRETORIA WANT
NOTHING TO DO WITH SWAPO, THE MODERATES
DEARLY WANT TO BE RID OF THE PROBLEM AND PERHAPS
COULD EVEN BRING THEMSELVES TO FACE WITHOUT
TEARS A SWAPO GOVERNMENT IN WINDHOEK.
THEY CAN LOOK FOR COMFORT TO ZIMBABWE, WHERE
THE PRAGMATIC MR MUGABE HAS NOT PROVED THE
BLOODTHIRSTY MARXIST HE WAS MADE OUT TO BE, AND
TO MOZAMBIQUE, WHERE MR MACHEL WOULD FIND IT
HARD TO KEEP HIS COUNTRY MOVING WITHOUT SOUTH
AFRICAN HELP. THERE IS REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT A
PRESIDENT NUJOMA LEADING A SWAPO
GOVERNMENT IN WINDHOEK WOULD FIT INTO THE
SAME MOULD, FOR ALTHOUGH NAMIBIA HAS DIAMONDS
AND URANIUM IT IS STILL LARGELY DEPENDENT ON
SOUTH AFRICA.
PRETORIA'S PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS NO
LONGER ANY TIME FOR THE LUXURY OF DEBATE IN THE
RULING NATIONAL PARTY. THE FIVE WESTERN POWERS
ARE RESTIVE, WARNING SOUTH AFRICA THAT THE
PROCRASTINATION CANNOT CONTINUE. THE UNITED
NATIONS NEGOTIATIONS, AT ONE TIME SO HOPEFUL,
ARE NOW ON THE BRINK OF FAILURE. SOUTH AFRICA
IS THREATENED WITH MANDATORY ECONOMIC
SANCTIONS. DECISION TIME IS HERE, AND IF THE
SOUTH AFRICANS ARE HOPING FOR A RONALD REAGAN
VICTORY ON 4 NOVEMBER TO WIN SYMPATHY AND
MORE TIME, THEY ARE PROBABLY TOO LATE. SO WHICH
WAY WILL PRETORIA SWING? THE PROPER AND
SENSIBLE COURSE IS TO BITE THE SWAPO BULLET AND
SUBMIT TO A DEMOCRATIC ELECTION UNDER UNITED
NATIONS SUPERVISION. SOUTH AFRICA, THROUGH ITS
DOMESTIC POLICIES, HAS LONG SINCE ABROGATED ITS
LEGAL AND MORAL CLAIMS TO NAMIBIA'S FUTURE. IT
IS FOR THE NAMIBIAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES TO DECIDE
WHO SHOULD GOVERN THEM.
IT WOULD BE FOOLISH AND FUTILE OF SOUTH
AFRICA TO TRY TO BLUNDER ON ALONE. THAT COURSE
HAS ALREADY BEEN WELL CHARTED IN ZIMBABWE.
THERE IS NO FUTURE IN RHODESIAN FRONT
WILFULNESS, OR IN PURSUING A GUERILLA WAR THAT
CAN NEVER BE WON, OR IN SETTING UP MUZOREWA-
STYLE GOVERNMENTS. IN NAMIBIA, THE STAKES ARE
EVEN HIGHER. ANGOLA HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE
CUBANS, WHO HAVE GIVEN THE SOUTH AFRICANS A
BLOODY NOSE ONCE BEFORE, WILL NOT GO HOME UNTIL
THE SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENCE FORCE STOPS ATTACKING
ITS TERRITORY. HOW WOULD THEY AND THE EAST
GERMANS AND THE SOVIET GENERALS IN LUANDA
REACT IF PRETORIA SNUBBED THE UNITED NATIONS
DEADLINE AND PRESSED ON ALONE?
THE DISTURBING THING THIS WEEK IS THAT  THE
SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT IS PLAYING UP ITS
DIFFERENCES WITH THE UNITED NATIONS AND
WARNING EVERYBODY WITHIN EARSHOT NOT TO
INTERFERE. THE BLUSTER IS FAMILIAR, BUT THE TIMING
IS ALL WRONG. THE GROUND OF WINDHOEK HAS BEEN
PREPARED THOROUGHLY. IT WOULD REQUIRE JUST ONE
EASY STEP FOR A UNILATERAL DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE. PRETORIA WOULD HASTEN TO
RECOGNISE THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND BACK IT WITH
MILITARY GUARANTEES. AND THE WORLD KNOWS WHERE
THAT LONELY ROAD LEADS.
"CAUTIOUS CHANGE OF LIQUOR LAWS"
THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN TWO AND A
HALF YEARS TO STUDY THE REPORT OF ITS BOARD
OF INQUIRY INTO THE LIQUOR LICENSING LAWS. THE
RESULT OF THIS PROLONGED RUMINATION HAS BEEN THE
REJECTION OF ITS MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS. THERE
IS TO BE SOME MINOR EASING OF RESTRICTIONS ON
THE SALE OF LIQUOR, AND SOME ENCOURAGEMENT OF
INNOVATION, BUT THE LICENSING LAWS WILL REMAIN
ALMOST AS COMPLEX AND ANOMALOUS AS BEFORE.
THE GOVERNMENT'S SOBER JUDGMENT REFLECTS A
FEELING - EVIDENTLY INFLUENCED BY THE IMPACT
OF ALCOHOL ON THE ROAD TOLL - THAT VICTORIANS ARE
NOT YET TO BE TRUSTED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER
OPPORTUNITIES TO DRINK IN HOTELS OR TO BUY LIQUOR
FOR HOME CONSUMPTION. THUS THE MAJORITY OF
CITIZENS WHO DRINK SENSIBLY WILL CONTINUE TO BE
RESTRAINED, ALTHOUGH NOT OPPRESSIVELY SO, IN THE
HOPE OF CURBING THE LETHAL PROPENSITIES OF THOSE
WHO DRINK TO EXCESS.
THE INQUIRY BY MR J.D. DAVIES, QC, WAS
THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF LIQUOR LICENSING
IN VICTORIA SINCE THE CELEBRATED PHILLIPS REPORT
IN 1966 LED TO THE END OF THE "SIX O'CLOCK SWILL"
IN HOTEL BARS AND THE INTRODUCTION OF CIVILISED
HOURS FOR RESTAURANTS. MR DAVIES FOUND THAT
WHILE THE COMMUNITY'S CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL
HAD INCREASED SINCE 1966, THE INCIDENCE OF HEAVY
DRINKING HAD DECLINED. HE THEREFORE AGREED WITH
SIR PHILIP PHILLIPS THAT IMPROVED STANDARDS OF
FACILITIES ENCOURAGED A MORE RESPONSIBLE
ATTITUDE TO DRINKING. WHILE HE RECOGNISED THAT
ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF A SANE LIQUOR CONTROL
POLICY MUST BE TO CONTAIN THE HAZARDS OF ALCOHOL
ABUSE, HE BELIEVED THAT SEVERE RESTRICTIONS WERE
UNDESIRABLE AND THAT THE EFFECT OF MINOR
RESTRICTIONS WAS LIKELY TO BE MINIMAL.
ACCORDINGLY, HE RECOMMENDED THAT HOTELS
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY OPEN UNTIL MIDNIGHT
INSTEAD OF 10 PM SIX DAYS A WEEK, AND THAT
HOTEL BAR AND BOTTLE SHOP TRADING BE ALLOWED ON
SUNDAYS FROM NOON TO 8 PM. THE GOVERNMENT
HAS REJECTED BOTH PROPOSALS. VICTORIA AND SOUTH
AUSTRALIA WILL REMAIN THE ONLY STATES NOT TO
PERMIT SUNDAY BAR TRADING. THE GOVERNMENT
JUSTIFIES THIS DECISION IN TERMS OF WHAT IT
BELIEVES TO BE PUBLIC OPINION AND OF THE LIKELY
CONSEQUENCES OF EXTENDED HOURS ON ROAD
CASUALTIES. IT MAY WELL BE THAT MOST VICTORIANS
PREFER SUNDAY RESTRICTIONS; WHETHER THERE IS A
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE SUNDAY ROAD TOLL IN
THE VARIOUS STATES WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS, HOWEVER, DECIDED TO ALLOW
SPORTING CLUBS SOME EXTENSION OF HOURS AND
LIMITED SUNDAY LIQUOR SALES, MAINLY, IT SEEMS,
BECAUSE EXISTING RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING WIDELY
FLOUTED. AND HOTELS WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR
SUPPER LICENCES TO 1 AM INSTEAD OF MIDNIGHT.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED THE
RECOMMENDATION FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE HOURS
HOTELS ARE REQUIRED TO OPEN, BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL
WHETHER THERE WILL BE MUCH CHANGE IN PRACTICE.
IT IS A PITY THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ACCEPTED MR
DAVIES' PROPOSALS FOR RATIONALISING THE DIFFERING
AND ANOMALOUS LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS FOR WINE
BARS AND CIDER TAVERNS. OVERALL, THE LICENSING
LAWS WILL CONTINUE TO REFLECT AN AD HOC ATTEMPT
TO RECONCILE CONFLICTING PRESSURES RATHER THAN A
RATIONAL AND BALANCED PHILOSOPHY. AT LEAST, THE
TREND HAS BEEN TOWARDS CAUTIOUS LIBERALISATION,
AND THE HOPE MUST BE THAT COMMUNITY ATTITUDES
AND BEHAVIOR WILL ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE.
<F35>
FRIDAY 31 OCTOBER 1980
"AND NOW FOR A NEW MINISTRY"
THE REMARKABLE ASPECT OF MR ANDREW
PEACOCK'S CHALLENGE FOR THE DEPUTY
LEADERSHIP OF THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENTARY LIBERAL
PARTY WAS NOT THAT IT FAILED BUT THAT HE CAME
WITHIN 12 VOTES OF UNSEATING MR PHILIP LYNCH.
THE SIGNIFICANCE IS THAT 35 OF THE 82 LIBERALS WHO
VOTED AT THE PARTY MEETING YESTERDAY DEFIED THE
PRIME MINISTER'S CLEARLY EXPRESSED PREFERENCE FOR
MR LYNCH AS THE PARTY DEPUTY. (THE NCP LEADER,
MR ANTHONY, WILL AGAIN BE DEPUTY PRIME
MINISTER IN THE COALITION GOVERNMENT.) MR
FRASER'S PREFERENCE IS UNDERSTANDABLE. MR LYNCH
HAS BEEN A LOYAL AND QUIETLY EFFICIENT DEPUTY,
WITH NO LEADERSHIP AMBITIONS OF HIS OWN. MR
PEACOCK IS MR FRASER'S PRINCIPAL RIVAL AND
WOULD-BE SUCCESSOR, URBANELY DIFFERENT IN STYLE
AND OUTLOOK, AND THE FOCUS OF THE "SMALL 1"
LIBERAL AND PERSONAL OPPOSITION TO THE PRIME
MINISTER WITHIN THE PARTY. INDEED, MR PEACOCK'S
CANDIDATURE WAS STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY RESTIVE
SENATORS WHO HAVE BEEN PRESSING MR FRASER, SO
FAR WITHOUT SUCCESS, FOR THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE
THEIR OWN LEADER IN THE SENATE.
THE CONTEST FOR THE DEPUTY LEADERSHIP HAS
DELAYED BY A DAY, AND PERHAPS COMPLICATED, MR
FRASER'S SELECTION OF HIS CABINET AND MINISTRY.
MR PEACOCK WANTS AND IS DUE FOR A TRANSFER FROM
FOREIGN AFFAIRS, WHERE HE HAS SERVED WITH
DISTINCTION SINCE 1975, TO AN IMPORTANT DOMESTIC
PORTFOLIO. HE HAS BEEN REPORTED TO FAVOR SOCIAL
SECURITY OR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. HIS HUMANE
ATTITUDES WOULD SEEM TO QUALIFY HIM FOR THE
FORMER AND HIS CONCILIATORY APPROACH FOR THE
LATTER. BUT WHILE BOTH PORTFOLIOS HAVE BEEN HELD
BY MINISTERS OF CABINET RANK, NEITHER REPRESENTS
A STRONG POLICY-MAKING DEPARTMENT. SENATOR
GUILFOYLE HAS BEEN ENGAGED MAINLY IN PROTECTING
WELFARE AGAINST ECONOMY CUTS, AND MR STREET IN
PRESIDING OVER A BATTERY OF MENACING INDUSTRIAL
LEGISLATION THAT CANNOT BE ENFORCED. WE SHOULD
PREFER TO SEE MR PEACOCK IN A MORE CHALLENGING
POST AND SUGGEST HE BE GIVEN CHARGE OF A NEW
COMBINED DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND RESOURCES,
WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR FORMULATING POLICIES TO
MANAGE THE RESOURCES BOOM. THE PRESENT DIVISION
BETWEEN ENERGY AND RESOURCES MAKES NO SENSE,
AND MR ANTHONY SHOULD CONFINE HIMSELF TO TRADE.
A LIBERAL PRIME MINISTER'S CHOICE OF
MINISTERS IS CONSTRAINED, OF COURSE, BY THE
NECESSITY TO ACCOMMODATE THE NATIONAL COUNTRY
PARTY AND TO BALANCE REPRESENTATION BETWEEN THE
TWO HOUSES (THE SENATE WILL WANT MORE
MINISTERS) AND AMONG THE STATES, AS WELL AS PARTY
FACTIONS. BUT WITHIN THESE LIMITS, MR FRASER
SHOULD TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRUNE SOME DEAD
WOOD, BRING IN SOME FRESH TALENT, AND MOVE SOME
MINISTERS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE SAME POST FOR
FIVE YEARS. SENATOR CARRICK, FOR INSTANCE, HAS
ENOUGH RESPONSIBILITY AS SENATE LEADER WITHOUT
MANAGING A DEPARTMENT AS WELL. MR KILLEN
SHOULD BE MOVED FROM DEFENCE, WHICH NEEDS A
GOOD ADMINISTRATOR AND A FIRM HAND. MR SINCLAIR,
WHO HAS TO BE BROUGHT BACK INTO CABINET IN A
SENIOR POST, WOULD BE A SUITABLE CANDIDATE.
ALTHOUGH MR KILLEN HAS THE SOPHISTICATION AND
EXPERIENCE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, WE SHOULD PREFER
A RISING MINISTER SUCH AS MR MACKELLAR OR MR
MACPHEE. ALTERNATIVELY, MR MACPHEE HAS THE
BACKGROUND AND QUALITIES TO HANDLE EMPLOYMENT
OR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, FROM WHICH MR STREET
DESERVES A BREAK. MR ELLICOTT WOULD BE A BETTER
ATTORNEY-GENERAL THAN SENATOR DURACK, AND WE
WOULD RATHER HE (MR ELLICOTT) STAYED IN POLITICS
THAN BE APPOINTED TO THE HIGH COURT. MR HOWARD
SHOULD REMAIN TREASURER AND UNDOUBTEDLY WILL.
SENATOR WITHERS WOULD BE SAFER BACK IN THE
MINISTRY THAN STIRRING DISSIDENCE ON THE BACK-
BENCHES, BUT HIS ROLE IN THE PEACOCK CHALLENGE
IS HARDLY LIKELY TO RECOMMEND HIM TO THE PRIME
MINISTER. CABINET-MAKING IS NO EASY TASK, BUT A
THOROUGH RESTRUCTURING WOULD BE BETTER THAN A
SOFT RESHUFFLE.
"THE HIGH COURT AND SECTION 92"
BISHOP HOADLEY OF BANGOR PUT HIS FINGER
ON THE PROBLEM BACK IN 1717."NAY", WROTE
THE BISHOP, "WHOEVER HATH AN ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY
TO INTERPRET ANY WRITTEN OR SPOKEN LAWS, IT IS HE
WHO IS THE LAWGIVER TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES,
AND NOT THE PERSON WHO FIRST WROTE OR SPAKE
THEM." NO ONE COULD HAVE SUMMED UP BETTER THE
CENTRAL PROBLEM RAISED BY THE HIGH COURT'S
INTERIM JUDGMENT THIS WEEK ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL
VALIDITY OF AUSTRALIA'S WHEAT STABILISATION
SCHEME. SINCE 1948 ALL WHEAT GROWN IN AUSTRALIA
HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO ACQUISITION BY THE AUSTRALIAN
WHEAT BOARD FOR STORAGE AND SALE, WITH THE AIM
OF PROTECTING AUSTRALIAN GROWERS AGAINST THE
VICISSITUDES OF DROUGHT AND INCOME FLUCTUATIONS.
NOW, FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THREE YEARS, THE
SCHEME HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN THE HIGH COURT
ON THE GROUND THAT IT BREACHES SECTION 92 OF
THE CONSTITUTION - THE SECTION WHICH GUARANTEES
FREE TRADE BETWEEN THE STATES. THE FIRST CHALLENGE
FAILED, NARROWLY. BUT THIS TIME, WITH ALL SEVEN
JUDGES SITTING, IT WOULD APPEAR FROM THEIR INTERIM
JUDGMENTS THAT THE LONG-STANDING STABILISATION
SCHEME - ONE SUPPORTED BY LIBERAL-NCP AND
LABOR GOVERNMENTS ALIKE - WILL BE THE NEXT
VICTIM OF THE HIGH COURT'S ECCENTRIC
INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 92.
FOR READERS WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH
SECTION 92, ITS KEY PASSAGE BEARS QUOTING: "ON
THE IMPOSITION OF UNIFORM DUTIES OF CUSTOMS,
TRADE, COMMERCE, AND INTERCOURSE AMONG THE
STATES, WHETHER BY MEANS OF INTERNAL CARRIAGE
OR OCEAN NAVIGATION, SHALL BE ABSOLUTELY FREE".
THOSE WHO SPOKE AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL
CONVENTIONS OF THE 1890S WERE IN NO DOUBT
ABOUT WHAT THEY MEANT BY IT: AS SIR SAMUEL
GRIFFITH PUT IT, "THE REAL MEANING IS THAT THE FREE
COURSE OF TRADE AND COMMERCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH IS NOT TO BE
INTERFERED WITH BY ANY TAXES, CHARGES OR
IMPOSTS". THIS WAS THE GENERAL APPROACH ADOPTED
BY THE HIGH COURT IN ITS EARLY YEARS, AS IN 1916
WHEN THE COURT - THEN COMPRISING SOME OF THE
AUTHORS OF THE CONSTITUTION - DISMISSED A
SIMILAR CHALLENGE TO AN EARLIER WHEAT STABILISATION
SCHEME. BUT IN THE 1930S AND 1940S, WITH THE
ORIGINAL JUDGES RETIRED, THE COURT CHANGED THIS
INTERPRETATION AND DECIDED TO READ SECTION 92 AS
BANNING THE COMPULSORY NATIONALISATION OF
ANYTHING - DRIED FRUITS, AIRLINES, BANKS - THAT
INVOLVED INTERSTATE TRADE. THE POLITICAL
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WERE PROFOUND, AND IN LINE
WITH THE CONSERVATIVE VIEWS OF THE JUDGES
CONCERNED. AS SIR ROBERT MENZIES REMARKED:
"THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT WHAT WE CALL
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IS ONLY HALF LAW AND HALF
PHILOSOPHY, POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY".
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY STILL SEEMS TO BE GUIDING
THE PRESENT BENCH OF THE HIGH COURT IN
INTERPRETING SECTION 92 FOR THE WHEAT BOARD
CASE. ONLY TWO JUDGES DELIVERED A FINAL DECISION.
SIR GARFIELD BARWICK, THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND A
FORMER LIBERAL POLITICIAN, UPHELD THE PRESENT
INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 92 AS USUAL AND
DECLARED THE STABILISATION SCHEME INVALID. MR
JUSTICE MURPHY, A FORMER LABOR POLITICIAN,
EQUALLY PREDICTABLY UPHELD THE INTERPRETATION OF
THE AUTHORS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND HELD THE
SCHEME TO BE VALID. THREE OTHER JUDGES RULED
THAT THE SCHEME WAS INVALID UNLESS THERE WERE
NO OTHER "PRACTICAL AND REASONABLE" WAY OF
REGULATING THE WHEAT TRADE, WHILE THE OTHER TWO
HELD THAT THE WHEAT BOARD WOULD HAVE TO SHOW
THAT THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE SCHEME
WERE "NO GREATER THAN ARE REASONABLY NECESSARY".
ALL FIVE AGREED THAT FURTHER HEARINGS WERE
NEEDED BEFORE THEY COULD HAND DOWN FINAL
DECISIONS.
THE WHEAT BOARD MAY HAVE BEEN GIVEN A
REPRIEVE, BUT THE FINAL OUTCOME SEEMS
NONETHELESS PREDICTABLE. CLEARLY THERE ARE OTHER
MEANS OF REGULATING THE WHEAT TRADE APART FROM
BUYING THE WHOLE CROP, AND INDEED THE INDUSTRIES
ASSISTANCE COMMISSION HAS RECOMMENDED A
DIFFERENT SCHEME IN ITS DRAFT REPORT ON THE WHEAT
INDUSTRY. BUT THE CHOICE BETWEEN THESE IS A
POLITICAL DECISION, AND IT SHOULD BE MADE BY THE
ELECTED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, NOT THE HIGH COURT.
WHILE THE SIX JUDGES WHO BELIEVE THAT SECTION 92
APPLIES TO THIS CASE HAVE PRESENT JUDICIAL PRACTICE
ON THEIR SIDE, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT COMMON
SENSE IS ON THE SIDE OF MR JUSTICE MURPHY IN
RULING THAT SUCH AN INTERPRETATION DISTORTS THE
CLEAR INTENT OF THE CONSTITUTION. WHAT IS NEEDED
NOW IS NOT SOME JUDICIAL DEXTERITY TO FIND A WAY
OF UPHOLDING THE STABILISATION SCHEME, AS IN
1978, BUT FOR THE COURT TO GO BACK TO INTERPRETING
SECTION 92 AS NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN IT WAS
INTENDED TO BE.
<F36>
SATURDAY 1 NOVEMBER 1980
"SCHOOL-TO-WORK MUDDLES"
HOW FAR IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S
MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR TRANSITION FROM SCHOOL
TO WORK SCHEME MERELY A PUBLIC RELATIONS
EXERCISE DESIGNED TO SOFTEN CRITICISM OF THE
EXTENT OF TEENAGE UNEMPLOYMENT? OR IS IT
MERELY A VAST BUREAUCRATIC BUNGLE? WHATEVER
THE VERDICT, THE FATE OF THE SCHEME REFLECTS
LITTLE CREDIT EITHER ON THE FEDERAL MINISTERS FOR
EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION WHO FIRST CONCEIVED
THE PROPOSAL A YEAR AGO, OR ON THOSE CHARGED
WITH PUTTING IT INTO EFFECT.
AS WE REPORTED THIS WEEK, VICTORIA APPEARS
TO HAVE LOST SOME $4 MILLION FOR ITS SCHOOL
LEAVERS AS A RESULT OF DELAYS IN GETTING THE
TRANSITION PROGRAMME UNDER WAY. OTHER STATES
MAY BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED ALTHOUGH THE
GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED TO RELEASE DETAILS OF
HOW MUCH MONEY IT HAS GIVEN OR WILL GIVE
THEM. INDEED, NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW MUCH
WILL BE SPENT ON TRANSITION COURSES THIS YEAR.
IN FEBRUARY, THE FEDERAL EDUCATION MINISTER,
MR FIFE, SAID IT WOULD BE $25 MILLION. BUT
BECAUSE OF THE CUMBERSOME PROCEDURES FOR
APPROVING PROGRAMMES WHICH THE COMMONWEALTH
HAS INSISTED ON ADOPTING, MOST STATES WILL BE
UNLIKELY TO GET THE FULL AMOUNT ORIGINALLY
PROMISED.
MR FIFE'S ANNOUNCEMENT SAID THAT VICTORIA'S
SHARE OF THE $25 MILLION WOULD BE $6.1 MILLION.
THE COMMONWEALTH NOW SAYS IT HAS APPROVED
A "CEILING" FIGURE OF $5.3 MILLION. BUT SO FAR
ONLY $2.2 MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO
PARTICULAR COURSES AND, WITH MANY STUDENTS
ONLY A MONTH AWAY FROM LEAVING SCHOOL, THE
PROSPECT OF GETTING MORE PROGRAMMES GOING IS
SLIGHT. UNDER FEDERAL GUIDELINES ANY MONEY NOT
SPENT BY THE STATES THIS YEAR CANNOT BE CARRIED
OVER TO 1981 AND INSTEAD REVERTS TO THE
COMMONWEALTH TREASURY. SO PROGRAMMES WHICH
RUN ON INTO NEXT YEAR MUST BE PAID FOR OUT
OF 1981 FUNDS WHICH MAY WELL MEAN THAT THERE
WILL BE LITTLE MONEY AVAILABLE FOR NEW COURSES
NEXT YEAR.
THIS IS A LONG WAY FROM THE HEADY
ANNOUNCEMENT IN NOVEMBER, 1979, WHEN THE
COMMONWEALTH DECLARED THAT $250 MILLION
WOULD BE SPENT ON TRANSITION PROGRAMMES OVER
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. EACH YEAR, 50,000 SCHOOL
LEAVERS IDENTIFIED AS POOR EMPLOYMENT
PROSPECTS WOULD BE OFFERED EXTRA INCENTIVES TO
STAY AT SCHOOL INSTEAD OF GOING ON THE DOLE.
THE STATES WOULD GIVE THESE STUDENTS SPECIAL
TRAINING AND GUIDANCE TO HELP THEM OVERCOME
DIFFICULTIES IN READING, WRITING AND ARITHMETIC,
AND IN SOME CASES WOULD PROVIDE PRE-VOCATIONAL
TRAINING.
BUT THE COMMONWEALTH ALSO SAID THAT
WHILE IT WOULD FUND THE FIRST YEAR, THE STATES
WOULD BE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE $109 MILLION
TO THE SCHEME OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. THE
STATES POINTEDLY ASKED WHERE THEY WOULD FIND
THAT SORT OF MONEY, AND REFUSED. SO NOW THE
COMMONWEALTH HAS AGREED TO FUND
PROGRAMMES IN 1980 AND 1981 WITH NO
CERTAINTY THAT MONEY WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE
THE YEAR AFTER. LAST YEAR'S GRAND $250 MILLION
WINDFALL FOR THE COUNTRY'S DISADVANTAGED
TEENAGERS HAS BECOME A CONFUSED, TWO-YEAR,
$40 MILLION SCHEME NOTED MORE FOR RED TAPE,
FRUSTRATION AND DELAYS THAN FOR HELP TO THOSE IN
NEED.
FOR INSTANCE, THE COMMONWEALTH INSISTS ON
USING ASTONISHINGLY AWKWARD METHODS TO GET
MONEY TO SCHOOLS THAT HAVE DEVISED TRANSITION
COURSES. ALL PROGRAMMES MUST BE APPROVED
FIRST BY A STATE AND THEN BY A CANBERRA
COMMITTEE AND THEN RECEIVE THE IMPRIMATUR OF
THE TWO MINISTERS FOR EDUCATION AND
EMPLOYMENT. EVEN THEN THE COMMONWEALTH
DOES NOT PAY OUT A LUMP SUM, BUT PASSES IT TO
THE STATES IN QUARTERLY GRANTS.
THESE METHODS HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT THE
TRANSITION SCHEME LACKS ANY COHERENT
PHILOSOPHY. IN ANY CASE, EVEN IF THE
ADMINISTRATION WERE SPEEDY AND EFFICIENT AND
THE PROGRAMMES SUCCESSFUL THE BASIC PROBLEM
WOULD NOT BE SOLVED. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE
ARE NOT ENOUGH JOBS. AS CRITICS CONTINUE TO
POINT OUT, MAKING SOME SCHOOL LEAVERS MORE
EMPLOYABLE MERELY SHUFFLES THE PACK OF THE
UNEMPLOYED.
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
"LOOK WHAT THESE CHRISTIANS ARE!" FROM
SHYLOCK'S DAY AND BEFORE, THIS HAS EVER
BEEN THE TAUNT OF THE UNGODLY WHEN THE
CHURCHES FALL OUT WITH EACH OTHER. IT IS A
PROPER ENOUGH STRICTURE. FOR HOW CAN WE
POSSIBLY RECONCILE WITH THE TEACHING OF CHRIST
THE TERRIBLE QUARRELS AND PERSECUTIONS WHICH
HAVE DEFACED THE HISTORY OF THE FOLLOWERS OF
THE PRINCE OF PEACE?
"IF MY KINGDOM WERE OF THIS WORLD, THEN
WOULD MY SERVANTS FIGHT", HE SAID, AND TOO
OFTEN HIS SERVANTS HAVE GIVEN EVIDENCE OF
HAVING INTERPRETED HIS KINGDOM AS BEING VERY
MUCH OF THIS WORLD.
WHICH, IN SOME MEASURE, IT IS. WHATEVER
MAY BE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ULTIMATE REALITY,
IMMEDIATE REALITY IS HERE AND NOW AND MANY
OF OUR DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE UPON THAT
BASIS. HENCE FOLLOW BOTH A PARADOX AND A
DILEMMA: THE PARADOX THAT THE MORE FIRMLY WE
BELIEVE THE TRUTHS WHICH WE HOLD TO BE IN TUNE
WITH THE ETERNAL VERITIES, THE MORE STRONG THE
NEED, OR THE TEMPTATION, TO STAND UP FOR THEM
AND FIGHT FOR THEM IN THIS WORLD; WHICH IS
AGAINST THE FUNDAMENTAL VERITY OF PEACE: AND
THE DILEMMA, THAT SINCE MANKIND HAS BY HIS
NATURE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE BETWEEN GOOD AND
EVIL IT IS INEVITABLE THAT THERE WILL BE
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE AS TO
WHICH IS WHICH.
IN CHRIST'S OWN KINGDOM THIS WILL
PRESUMABLY NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE THE TRUTH
WILL BE KNOWN. OF THE EARTHLY DILEMMA THERE
CAN BE NO PERFECT SOLUTION. IT MUST BE ACCEPTED
THAT MEN AND WOMEN WILL DISAGREE AND EVEN
QUARREL, AND THAT THEY WILL BE MORE PRONE TO
SUCH QUARRELLING THE MORE STRONGLY THEY FEEL
ABOUT THE ISSUE.
THUS THERE MAY WELL BE MORE BITTER
DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT RELIGION AND MUSIC AND
EDUCATION AND POLITICS AND CONSERVATION ISSUES
BECAUSE THESE ARE ISSUES UPON WHICH MEN AND
WOMEN FEEL MOST DEEPLY.
FOR THE CHRISTIAN ESPECIALLY, AND FOR ALL
REASONABLE PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL, THERE SHOULD BE
QUALIFICATIONS. RECOGNISING THE FACT OF THE
DILEMMA, BOTH SIDES SHOULD ENDEAVOR TO
UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE RIGHT OF THE OTHER
TO COME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION AND TO FEEL
AS STRONGLY ABOUT IT AS THEY DO THEMSELVES.
THERE IS EVEN THE APPALLING POSSIBILITY, IN
THE WORDS OF OLIVER CROMWELL, WHO SELDOM
APPLIES THEM TO HIMSELF, "I BESEECH YOU IN THE
BOWELS OF CHRIST, THINK IT POSSIBLE YOU MAY BE
MISTAKEN".
WITH THIS IN MIND, NEITHER SIDE SHOULD
IMPUTE ANY LOWER MOTIVES ON THE PART OF OTHERS
THAN THEY ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT ON THEIR OWN.
THE ARGUMENT SHOULD BE CONDUCTED WITH MUTUAL
RESPECT, WITH DECENCY, AND WITH TOLERANCE.
IF, AND ONLY IF, ARGUMENT CAN BE KEPT
WITHIN THESE BOUNDS, CAN THERE BE ANY HOPE
OF COMPROMISE OR OF THE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN
BOTH OPPONENTS WHICH WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE
FOR THEM TO LIVE TOGETHER IN THE KINGDOM OF
THIS WORLD WITH A FORETASTE OF THE HARMONY
WHICH CAN BE EXPECTED IN THE NEXT, AND ONLY
SO CAN THE PROTAGONISTS DEFEND THEMSELVES
AGAINST THE CRITICISM OF THOSE WHO WOULD
CONDEMN THEM.
THE EASIER ANSWER OF NOT THINKING THAT
THERE IS ANYTHING WHICH MATTERS ENOUGH TO
FIGHT ABOUT IS NO ANSWER. TOLERANCE AND
DECENCY MUST NOT BECOME APATHY, FOR THAT IS
THE ESCAPE OF THE INDOLENT, THE COWARDLY AND
THE UNFEELING.
<F37>
MONDAY 3 NOVEMBER 1980
"THREAT OF SINGLE ISSUE POLITICS"
LATER THIS WEEK, THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WILL
BE ASKED TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION CALLING ON
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND THE PARTIES THEY
REPRESENT TO "IGNORE THREATS AND BLANDISHMENTS
BY THE PROMOTERS OF SINGLE ISSUES". A FEW YEARS
AGO, SUCH A MOTION MIGHT HAVE PUZZLED PARLIA-
MENTARIANS AND PUBLIC ALIKE. NOW MEMBERS ON
BOTH SIDES ARE LIKELY TO FIND COMMON GROUND IN
RESISTING WHAT SOME OF THEM SEE AS AN INSIDIOUS
THREAT TO PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY. DR KEVIN
FOLEY, A LIBERAL BACKBENCHER WHO HAS BEEN A
FOREMOST ADVOCATE OF PARLIAMENTARY, BUDGETARY
AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM, PUT THE MOTION IN THE
BELIEF THAT SINGLE ISSUE POLITICS ARE "A NEW AND
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FORCE... WITH A VERY REAL
ABILITY TO CHANGE, IN A FUNDAMENTAL AND
UNFAVORABLE WAY, THE CHARACTER OF AUSTRALIAN
GOVERNMENT".
THE DEFEAT, AFTER TWO WEEKS OF SUSPENSE, OF
MR BARRY SIMON IN THE FEDERAL ELECTORATE OF
MCMILLAN UNDERSCORES DR FOLEY'S CONCERN. MR
SIMON WAS THE TARGET OF A CAMPAIGN BY A MILITANT
FACTION OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE MOVEMENT, WHICH
PURSUES ITS CRUSADE FOR PROHIBITIVE LAWS AGAINST
ABORTION BY URGING PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR OR AGAINST
PARTICULAR CANDIDATES. ALTHOUGH MR SIMON IS A
LIBERAL, MEMBERS OF OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN
UNDER SIMILAR PRESSURE. DR FOLEY IS NOT OBJECTING
TO THE MOTIVES OF GROUPS SUCH AS THIS, BUT TO THEIR
METHODS. HE ARGUES WITH GOOD SENSE THAT
ELECTIONS SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE JUDGMENT OF
THE ELECTORATE ON OVERALL POLICIES, PROGRAMMES,
RECORDS AND CREDIBILITY, AND THAT PARLIAMEN-
TARIANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE ON WHAT IS BEST
FOR THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT BEING THREATENED BY
PRESSURE GROUPS WITH AN OBSESSIVE AND
UNBALANCED ATTITUDE TO A SINGLE ISSUE.
SINGLE ISSUE POLITICS, ALTHOUGH RELATIVELY
NEW IN AUSTRALIA, HAVE INCREASINGLY DISTORTED THE
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL
GOVERNMENT LEVELS IN THE UNITED STATES. SINGLE-
INTEREST GROUPS ARE OF TWO BROAD KINDS: THOSE
WITH AN IDEOLOGICAL BASIS AND THOSE WITH A
PECUNIARY INTEREST. THE LATTER INCLUDE SOME
15,000 LOBBYISTS IN WASHINGTON WHO SPEND ABOUT
$2 BILLION A YEAR PUSHING THEIR PARTICULAR
BARROWS. THEIR INTENSE PRESSURES FOR LEGISLATIVE
FAVORS HAVE LED TO WIDESPREAD BRIBERY AND
CORRUPTION TO AN EXTENT THAT MANY
REPRESENTATIVES AND OFFICIALS OWE THEIR POSITION
TO SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS OR CORPORATIONS
RATHER THAN TO THE PARTIES THEY CLAIM TO REPRESENT.
DR FOLEY'S MOTION DESERVES SUPPORT. IT
SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS A BLANKET CONDEMNATION
OF ALL ORGANISATIONS WHO CAMPAIGN, QUITE
LEGITIMATELY, FOR SINGLE ISSUES. RATHER, IT SHOULD
BE TAKEN AS A NECESSARY STAND AGAINST THOSE WHO,
AS DR FOLEY PUT IT,"SEEK TO CONTROL, TO SUBVERT,
TO CORRUPT, TO PERSONALISE AND TO VILIFY". THERE
ARE ALSO TWO PRACTICAL MEASURES THAT THE LIBERAL
AND LABOR PARTIES SHOULD BOTH CONSIDER. ONE IS
TO ADOPT CLEAR AND CONSISTENT POLICIES ON SUCH
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES AS ABORTION LAW, RATHER THAN
TO LEAVE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES
EXPOSED TO PERSONAL PRESSURES. WHETHER TO SEEK
OR CONSENT TO AN ABORTION MAY WELL BE A MATTER
OF PERSONAL CONSCIENCE; WHERE TO DRAW THE LEGAL
LINE IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY AND SHOULD BE
TREATED AS SUCH. THE OTHER MEASURE IS TO
INTRODUCE AN AGREED PROGRAMME OF PUBLIC
FUNDING OF ELECTION CAMPAIGNS, AND TO LIMIT
POLITICAL ADVERTISING, TO REDUCE THE FINANCIAL
INFLUENCE OF PRIVATE AND CORPORATE CONTRIBUTORS
TO PARTY FUNDS.
"THE HAZARDS OF NUCLEAR WASTE"
THE RISE OF THE NUCLEAR ENERGY AGE HAS BEEN
ACCOMPANIED BY A MULTITUDE OF WORRIES AS
TO WHAT TO DO WITH THE WASTE. SOME PEOPLE
WANT TO BURY IT. OTHERS LIKE TO DUMP IT AT SEA.
A FEW ADVOCATE THAT IT SHOULD BE SHOT INTO
SPACE. ONE THING IS CLEAR: NO TECHNIQUE HAS
BEEN PROVED SAFE. IT MAY BE THAT MANKIND WILL
NEVER FEEL TOTALLY ASSURED. CERTAINLY THERE HAVE
BEEN HOPEFUL SUGGESTIONS, SUCH AS THE PROCESS
OUTLINED MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO BY AUSTRALIA'S
PROFESSOR RINGWOOD, WHO BELIEVES HE HAS A WAY
OF IMMOBILISING NUCLEAR WASTES BY INCORPORATING
THEM IN SYNTHETIC ROCK. EVEN IF A SAFE METHOD
WERE PROVED, HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE LIKELY TO
HAVE A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE SIDE-EFFECTS.
IT WOULD ENCOURAGE URANIUM MINING,
EXPANDING THE THREAT TO THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT,
AND IN AUSTRALIA, FOR EXAMPLE, TO ABORIGINES.
IT WOULD ENCOURAGE THE CONSTRUCTION OF MORE
NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN
COUNTRIES WHICH MAY BE WILLING TO CUT COSTS BY
CUTTING CORNERS, THUS MULTIPLYING THE RISK OF A
THREE MILE ISLAND INCIDENT. MOST SERIOUSLY, IT
WOULD PROVIDE THE RAW MATERIALS FOR THE
PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WITH THE
INCREASING DANGER THAT THOSE WEAPONS WOULD
COME INTO THE WRONG HANDS. THE POINT ABOUT
NUCLEAR ENERGY IS THAT NOTHING SHOULD BE TAKEN
FOR GRANTED, EVEN THE MOST STRINGENT SAFEGUARDS
AGREEMENTS.
GOVERNMENTS THAT TAKE ON THE AWESOME
RESPONSIBILITY OF NUCLEAR POWER ALSO TAKE ON A
RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AFTER THE WASTE, AND
PARTICULARLY NOT TO INFLICT IT ON OTHERS. OF COURSE
IT IS BOTHERSOME. GOVERNMENTS LIKE TO CITE THE
FACT THAT A BAN ON NUCLEAR POWERWOULD CAUSE
A SHARP CUT IN EVERYONE'S STANDARD OF LIVING.
NOWHERE IS THIS PROBLEM MORE ACUTE THAN IN
JAPAN, WHICH HAS TO IMPORT ALMOST ALL ITS
ENERGY. ITS EXISTING NUCLEAR POWER CAPACITY OF
15 MILLION KILOWATTS MAKES IT THE SECOND BIGGEST
INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY COUNTRY. IT IS
FACED WITH A HUGE STOCKPILE OF APPARENTLY
LOW-LEVEL WASTE, WHICH IT WANTS TO START DUMPING
IN THE PACIFIC, ALREADY THE WORLD'S FAVORITE
NUCLEAR TEST AREA.
THE PACIFIC NATIONS ARE ALARMED - WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF AUSTRALIA, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO
PROVIDE ABOUT 4 PER CENT OF JAPAN'S URANIUM
NEEDS AND SAYS DIPLOMATICALLY THAT IT NEITHER
APPROVES NOR DISAPPROVES OF THE DUMPING
PROPOSAL. NO ONE DENIES THAT JAPAN HAS A
PROBLEM. NO ONE CAN PROVE THAT ITS PLAN IS
DANGEROUS, BUT, EQUALLY, NO ONE CAN PROVE THAT
IT IS SAFE ONCE THE BARRELS HAVE BEEN DUMPED
IRRETRIEVABLY INTO AN OCEAN RINGED BY AN
EARTHQUAKE ZONE. JAPAN - AND THOSE EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES ALREADY DUMPING WASTE IN THE
ATLANTIC - SHOULD THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THEIR
INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.
AS THE WORLD'S ENERGY NEEDS INCREASE, AND
TRADITIONAL SOURCES DECLINE, SOME GOVERNMENTS
SEE AN EASY WAY OUT BY DEVELOPING FAST  BREEDER
FUSION REACTORS. BUT THESE REACTORS ARE UNLIKELY
TO CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BEFORE
THE YEAR 2030. HOWEVER, THERE IS AT LEAST A
CHANCE THAT, BEFORE THAT TIME, SOLAR ENERGY
TECHNOLOGY WILL HAVE ADVANCED TO A MATURE AND
COMMERCIALLY FEASIBLE STAGE. NO ONE COULD
PRETEND THAT SOLAR ENERGY IS THE ENTIRE ANSWER
TO THE GREAT QUESTIONS ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER AND
WASTE. IN ANY EVENT, THE WORLD WILL HAVE TO
RELY ON CONVENTIONAL NUCLEAR REACTORS, AS WELL
AS OIL AND COAL, UNTIL THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.
BUT WHAT WE NEED NOW IS MORE SMALL-SCALE
SOLAR ENERGY WHERE CLIMATE PERMITS (AUSTRALIA,
FOR EXAMPLE). ABOVE ALL WE NEED RESEARCH ON AN
INTERNATIONAL SCALE TO TEST WHETHER THE WORLD
ULTIMATELY CAN TURN TO THE SUN AS A SAFE AND
SIGNIFICANT PROVIDER OF POWER. MEANWHILE, AS
AUSTRALIA'S RETIRING AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE FOR
NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION AND SAFEGUARDS, MR
JUSTICE FOX, SAYS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET IN PLACE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE A SCHEME IN WHICH STOCKS
OF PLUTONIUM FALL UNDER INTERNATIONAL CONTROL.
MR JUSTICE FOX ALSO ADVOCATES INTERNATIONAL AND
MULTI-NATIONAL SAFEGUARDS ARRANGEMENTS. HE IS
RIGHT. NUCLEAR ISSUES ARE FAR TOO HAZARDOUS TO
BE LEFT TO THE WHIMS OF INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENTS.

TUESDAY 4 NOVEMBER 1980
"THE NEW FRASER MINISTRY"
THE ULTIMATE POWER OF A PRIME MINISTER OVER
HIS PARTY IS THE POWER TO REWARD LOYALTY AND
PUNISH DISSENTERS WHEN HE COMES TO FORM HIS
MINISTRY. COALITION PARTNERS MUST BE KEPT HAPPY,
AND ALL STATES REPRESENTED. THESE FACTORS HAVE
BEEN SO IMPORTANT IN THE SHAPING OF THE NEW
FRASER MINISTRY THAT THEY HAVE OVERSHADOWED THE
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF WHETHER THE RIGHT PEOPLE
ARE BEING PUT IN THE RIGHT JOBS. THE WONDER IS
THAT - WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS - THE INCOMING
MINISTRY SEEMS NOT TOO BAD AT ALL. WHILE THE
DEMOTION OF MR ROBINSON AND THE REASSIGNMENT
OF MR PEACOCK HAVE DOMINATED DISCUSSION OF
THE NEW RULING TEAM, IT SHOULD BE SAID FIRST OF ALL
THAT, BY AND LARGE, MR FRASER APPEARS TO HAVE
CHOSEN WELL. COMPETENCE AND INTELLIGENCE HAVE
BEEN REWARDED AS WELL AS LOYALTY, AND PARTICULAR
CARE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO SELECTING GOOD
MINISTERS FOR PORTFOLIOS WHICH DEAL MOST CLOSELY
WITH THE PROBLEMS OF THE POOR. IT IS A PITY THAT
THERE ARE SOME GLARING EXCEPTIONS TO THESE
GENERALISATIONS; BUT THE OVERALL IMPRESSION IS A
FAVORABLE ONE.
THE PRIME MINISTER'S PROBLEM IN PLACING MR
PEACOCK HAS BEEN RESOLVED BY A SIMPLE SWAP
WHICH FEW ANTICIPATED, BUT WHICH MAKES GOOD
SENSE. THE TRADES HALLS OF INDUSTRIAL AUSTRALIA
MAY BE FAR REMOVED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL
CIRCUIT ON WHICH ANDREW PEACOCK HAS TRAVELLED
IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. BUT HIS NEW MINISTRY IS
ONE WHICH REQUIRES SIMILAR SKILLS OF NEGOTIATION
- THE ABILITY TO SEE LEGITIMATE ARGUMENTS PUT BY
OPPOSING SIDES AND TO PERSUADE EACH TO BEND A BIT
TO MAKE THIS A MORE PEACEFUL WORLD. INDUSTRIAL
RELATIONS IS AN IMPORTANT MINISTRY IN AUSTRALIA,
WHERE MANY UNIONS ARE STILL FAR FROM RECOGNISING
THAT THEY HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE COMMUNITY
AT LARGE AS WELL AS TO THEIR OWN MEMBERS. OUR
RECORD OF STRIKES IS ONE OF THE FIVE WORST IN THE
WESTERN WORLD AND HAS BEGUN TO CLOUD
AUSTRALIA'S REPUTATION AS A RELIABLE TRADING
PARTNER. POLITICALLY, THE CHOICE OF MR PEACOCK IS
A CLEVER MOVE WHICH COULD LARGELY NEUTRALISE THE
ADVANTAGE LABOR WILL GAIN FROM HAVING MR BOB
HAWKE AS ITS SPOKESMAN ON INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.
IT WILL BE FASCINATING TO SEE HOW THESE TWO
ASPIRANTS TO THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP SHAPE UP
AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS.
MR STREET, FOR HIS PART, SEEMS ADEQUATELY
QUALIFIED FOR HIS NEW ROLE AS MINISTER FOR FOREIGN
AFFAIRS. A DILIGENT, EXPERIENCED MINISTER, A
SYMPATHETIC LISTENER WHO ALWAYS THINKS BEFORE
SPEAKING, HE WILL HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OVERSEAS OF
BEING KNOWN TO BE VERY CLOSE TO THE PRIME
MINISTER. THE ONLY RESERVATION IS THAT HE MAY BE
TOO CLOSE TO MR FRASER, WHOSE OBSESSION WITH THE
SPREAD OF RUSSIAN AND VIETNAMESE COMMUNISM
NEEDS TO BE OFFSET BY A LESS DOGMATIC VIEW OF
THE WORLD.
THE PEACOCK-STREET TRANSFER IS PERHAPS THE
MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE CHANGE IN THE NEW
MINISTRY. BUT ANY RESHUFFLE WHICH SEES THE
RETIREMENT OF SACKING OF SIX MINISTERS AND THE
ELEVATION OF FIVE NEW ONES HAS A GREATER
SIGNIFICANCE. BY AND LARGE, THE MINISTRY LOOKS
THE BETTER FOR THE CHANGES - YET IT WOULD
HAVE LOOKED BETTER STILL HAD THE PRIME MINISTER
BEEN A BIT MORE RUTHLESS. IN AT LEAST FOUR CASES,
LOYALTY TO THE PRIME MINISTER - IN THE
QUEENSLAND COALITION ROW, OR PERHAPS IN LAST
WEEK'S VOTE FOR THE DEPUTY LEADERSHIP - APPEARS
TO HAVE BEEN REWARDED AT THE EXPENSE OF
PRODUCING A BETTER MINISTRY.
SENATOR CARRICK, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A MAN
OF CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE IN THE PARTY,
PARTICULARLY IN NEW SOUTH WALES. BUT HE HAS
FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE IS SUITED TO
RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN AREA AS FULL OF COMPLEX
POLICY QUESTIONS AS NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND
ENERGY. HIS OWN WISH TO RETAIN THE PORTFOLIO
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO OVERRIDE THE
NATION'S NEED FOR A MINISTER BETTER QUALIFIED TO
ENSURE THAT AUSTRALIA GETS THE GREATEST BENEFIT
FROM THE RESOURCES BOOM AT THE LEAST SOCIAL
AND ECONOMIC COST. MR KILLEN REMAINS MINISTER
FOR DEFENCE, TO THE SATISFACTION OF FEW EXCEPT
HIMSELF. THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF MR IAN
VINER, WHO AS MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT HAS
TENDED TO APPEAR ABRASIVE AND UNSYMPATHETIC
WITH THE PROBLEMS OF THE JOBLESS. WHAT
AUSTRALIA NEEDS IS A MINISTER WITH ENOUGH
HUMANE CONCERN TO FORCE POLICY CHANGES TO
ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY MASS
UNEMPLOYMENT AND BY THE SYSTEM'S FAILURE TO
TRAIN THE UNEMPLOYED FOR THE SKILLED JOBS
BECOMING AVAILABLE.
THE REAPPOINTMENT OF MR VINER SEEMS ALL
THE MORE STRANGE BECAUSE, IN OTHER SENSITIVE
AREAS, MR FRASER HAS MADE EXCELLENT CHOICES.
IN DAME MARGARET GUILFOYLE, AUSTRALIA WILL
HAVE A FINANCE MINISTER WHO IS NOT MERELY OF
UNQUESTIONED COMPETENCE, BUT ALSO HAS SHOWN
A DETERMINATION TO SEE THAT BUDGET CUTBACKS ARE
NOT MADE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE POOR. HER
REPLACEMENT AT SOCIAL SECURITY, SENATOR FRED
CHANEY, SHOWED AN UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL
PROBLEMS IN HIS PREVIOUS ROLE AS MINISTER FOR
ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS. SIMILARLY, HIS REPLACEMENT,
SENATOR PETER BAUME, SEEMS A GOOD CHOICE FOR
A PORTFOLIO WHICH REQUIRES MORE THAN THE USUAL
DEGREE OF CONSTRUCTIVE COMPASSION. THESE
QUALITIES ARE ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT IN A
GOVERNMENT SUCH AS MR FRASER'S, WHICH HAS
MORE THAN ENOUGH PEOPLE LACKING THEM, AND HAS
BEEN WIDELY SEEN AS BEING UNSYMPATHETIC TO
THE POOR.
OTHER CHANGES MIGHT HAVE IMPROVED THE
MINISTRY. WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO SEE MR
ELLICOTT RETURN AS ATTORNEY-GENERAL RATHER THAN
APPARENTLY LIE IN WAITING FOR THE POST OF CHIEF
JUSTICE - A POST FROM WHICH HIS PAST POLITICAL
ACTIVITIES SHOULD CLEARLY EXCLUDE HIM. MR IAN
MACPHEE AND SENATOR PETER RAE ARE PEOPLE WHO
COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO KEY ECONOMIC
PORTFOLIOS WITH ADVANTAGE. IT IS DISAPPOINTING
THAT MR KEVIN NEWMAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN
RETAINED IN THE MINISTRY AT THE EXPENSE OF
SENATOR RAE.
BUT THE ASPECT OF THE NEW MINISTRY WHICH
COULD ULTIMATELY COST MR FRASER MOST WAS THE
SACKING OF MR ERIC ROBINSON FROM THE CABINET
- AND HIS REFUSAL TO SERVE IN THE JUNIOR
PORTFOLIO OFFERED TO HIM. THIS STANDS IN STRANGE
CONTRAST TO MR FRASER'S RELUCTANCE TO SHIFT MR
KILLEN, SENATOR CARRICK OR MR VINER. IT SEEMS
EVIDENT THAT MR ROBINSON'S DISPLACEMENT WAS
THE DIRECT RESULT OF HIS ROLE IN PERSUADING THE
QUEENSLAND BRANCH OF THE LIBERAL PARTY TO
STAND UP TO THE FOLLIES OF MR BJELKE-PETERSEN
AND HIS GOVERNMENT. IT HAS OFTEN BEEN
SUGGESTED THAT MR FRASER LISTENS MORE TO HIS
NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY COLLEAGUES THAN TO
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY; THIS SEEMS A CLASSIC
EXAMPLE. QUITE APART FROM THE POLITICAL WISDOM
OF PUTTING MR ROBINSON ON THE BACKBENCH -
AND IT SEEMS A CONSIDERABLE RISK FOR MR FRASER
TO TAKE - IT APPEARS THAT MR FRASER HAS SIDED
WITH THE NCP AGAINST THE STATE BRANCH OF HIS
OWN PARTY. ALL TOLD, HOWEVER, IT IS NOT A BAD
MINISTRY. THE PITY IS THAT IT IS NOT BETTER.
<F39>
WEDNESDAY 5 NOVEMBER 1980
"JURIES: CASE FOR INQUIRY"
THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF POLICE, MR MILLER,
HAS SPOKEN OUT FREQUENTLY AND FORCEFULLY
ON WHAT HE SEES AS AN IMBALANCE IN THE SCALES
OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE. HE BELIEVES THAT THE SYSTEM,
INHERITED BY AUSTRALIA AFTER CENTURIES OF
EVOLUTION IN ENGLAND, IS WEIGHTED UNDULY IN
FAVOR OF THOSE ACCUSED OF CRIMINAL OFFENCES.
THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE UNTIL PROVEN
GUILTY, THE LIMITATIONS ON POLICE INVESTIGATION
AND INTERROGATION, THE RULES OF EVIDENCE IN
COURT AND ESPECIALLY THE TRADITION OF TRIAL BY
JURY ALL APPEAR TO COMBINE TO GIVE THE GUILTY
MORE THAN A SPORTING CHANCE TO GO FREE AND
PROBABLY OFFEND AGAIN. AS A RESULT, HE ARGUES,
COMMUNITY PROTECTION IS DIMINISHED AND POLICE
MORALE IS WEAKENED.
MR MILLER IS NOT ALONE IN ARGUING THAT TRIAL
BY JURY HAS BECOME OBSOLETE AND OUGHT TO BE
MODIFIED, IF NOT ABOLISHED OUTRIGHT. ITS MAIN
OBJECT ORIGINALLY WAS TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL
AGAINST THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE STATE AND,
IN PARTICULAR, OF JUDGES WHEN NO OTHER
PROTECTION WAS AVAILABLE. THE BELIEF THAT IT IS
A GUARANTEE OF CIVIL LIBERTIES REMAINS IMPLANTED
IN LEGAL MYTHOLOGY AND PUBLIC OPINION. ITS
CRITICS ARGUE THAT SOCIETY NOW HAS MORE TO FEAR
FROM ORGANISED CRIME THAN STATE OPPRESSION,
AND THAT JURIES, WHILE THEY MAY SOMETIMES BE
SWAYED BY EMOTION TO CONVICT AGAINST
PSYCHIATRIC EVIDENCE OF DIMINISHED
RESPONSIBILITY, ARE TOO INCLINED TO ACQUIT. THE
POLICE SURGEON, DR PETER BUSH, HAS COMPLAINED
FOR INSTANCE THAT JURIES REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT
DRIVERS WITH HIGH BLOOD ALCOHOL READINGS WERE
INCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THEIR CARS, AND THAT
CONSEQUENTLY DRUNK DRIVERS ARE ESCAPING
CONVICTION ON LEGAL TECHNICALITIES. IT HAS ALSO
BEEN ARGUED THAT JURIES ARE INCAPABLE OF
UNDERSTANDING COMPLEX CASES INVOLVING
CORPORATE CRIME, THAT THEY ARE OPEN TO
INTIMIDATION IN CASES INVOLVING VIOLENT
ORGANISED CRIME, AND THAT THEY ARE UNDULY
LIBERAL IN AWARDING DAMAGES IN SOME CIVIL
CASES.
MUCH OF THIS CRITICISM IS, HOWEVER, BASED
ON CONJECTURE. MR MILLER DRAWS A COMPARISON
BETWEEN MAGISTRATES' COURTS, WHERE ONLY ABOUT
10 PER CENT OF DEFENDANTS ARE DISCHARGED, AND
HIGHER COURTS, WHERE JURIES ACQUIT ABOUT HALF
THE ACCUSED PERSONS TRIED BEFORE THEM. BUT IT
MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MOST PERSONS
COMMITTED FOR TRIAL PLEAD GUILTY AND SO COME
ONLY BEFORE A JUDGE FOR SENTENCE. THERE IS ALSO
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE ACQUITTAL RATE IN
VICTORIAN COURTS HAS BARELY CHANGED OVER THE
PAST 20 YEARS. ONE PROBLEM IS THAT NO ONE
REALLY KNOWS, EXCEPT THOSE WHO SERVE ON A
JURY IN A PARTICULAR CASE, HOW JURIES ARRIVE AT
THEIR VERDICTS. MR MILLER HAS EXPRESSED THE
BELIEF THAT IF THE SECRETS OF THE JURY ROOM WERE
REVEALED, THE CASE FOR ABOLITION OF JURIES WOULD
BE PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. HOW THIS
REVELATION IS TO BE ACHIEVED IS HARD TO SAY,
GIVEN THE PRESENT INSISTENCE ON SECRECY. EVEN
IF UNDER STRINGENT SAFEGUARDS RESEARCHERS WERE
ALLOWED TO OBSERVE OR TAPE-RECORD JURY
DELIBERATIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A JURY'S
AWARENESS OF SUCH MONITORING WOULD INFLUENCE
ITS ATTITUDES.
INTRUSION OR EAVESDROPPING MAY BE TOO
DRASTIC A MEASURE, BUT THERE IS A CASE, AND
ONE CAUTIOUSLY SUPPORTED BY THE ATTORNEY-
GENERAL, MR STOREY, QC, AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES,
FOR AN INQUIRY INTO THE JURY SYSTEM. IT IS WORTH
COMPARING THE VICTORIAN EXPERIENCE, FOR
EXAMPLE, WITH THAT IN OTHER STATES AND
COUNTRIES. THERE MAY BE A CASE FOR RESERVING
CERTAIN TYPES OF TRIAL FOR JUDGES WITHOUT A JURY,
OR FOR JUDGES WITH LAY ASSESSORS. ANOTHER
PROPOSAL, ADOPTED IN ENGLAND, SOUTH AUSTRALIA,
WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIA, IS FOR
ACCEPTANCE OF MAJORITY VERDICTS (USUALLY 10 TO
2). AGAINST THIS, IT MAY BE ARGUED THAT IT
DETRACTS FROM THE CONCEPT THAT A PERSON MUST
BE FOUND GUILTY "BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT",
AND THAT THE ACQUITTAL RATE IN JURISDICTIONS WITH
MAJORITY VERDICTS IS NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE IN WHICH UNANIMOUS VERDICTS ARE REQUIRED
FOR CONVICTION. IN OUR VIEW, THERE IS A PRIMA
FACIE CASE FOR INQUIRY INTO THE JURY SYSTEM AND
FOR CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES. BUT THE ONUS
MUST BE ON THE CRITICS TO PROVE THAT THE PRESENT
SYSTEM IS UNSATISFACTORY TO A DEGREE THAT MAKES
MODIFICATION PREFERABLE.
"BEATING THE DONKEYS"
HOW FAR DOES MR MALCOLM FRASER OWE HIS
MAJORITY TO AUSTRALIA'S DONKEYS? THAT IS ONE
OF THE QUESTIONS BEING ASKED AFTER AN ELECTION
WHICH SAW THE FRASER GOVERNMENT WIN NO FEWER
THAN 17 SEATS BY MAJORITIES OF LESS THAN 2 PER
CENT. IN 12 OF THESE SEATS, ITS VICTORIES MAY HAVE
BEEN DUE TO THE "DONKEY VOTE" - THE
WELL-PROVEN PRACTICE OF MANY VOTERS TO VOTE FOR
WHOEVER IS LISTED ON TOP OF THE BALLOT PAPER,
REGARDLESS OF PARTY, AND TO DISTRIBUTE PREFERENCES
STRAIGHT DOWN THE CARD "1,2,3,4...". SINCE
CANDIDATES' NAMES ARE LISTED ON THE BALLOT PAPER
IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER, THE GOVERNMENT CANDIDATES
IN THESE 12 SEATS - MESSRS BIRNEY, BOURCHIER,
BRADFIELD, BUNGEY, BURR, &C - REAPED THE DONKEY
VOTE, AND THUS RETAINED THEIR SEATS. IN FOUR OTHER
SEATS, LABOR CANDIDATES WON FOR THE SAME REASON.
AND NOW LABOR MP MR BARRY COHEN HAS URGED
HIS PARTY TO TAKE NOTE IN FUTURE PRE-SELECTIONS AND
GIVE PRIORITY TO CANDIDATES WHOSE NAMES BEGIN
WITH THE FIRST LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET. AS HE POINTS
OUT, THE DONKEY VOTE COULD DETERMINE WHO WINS
THE NEXT ELECTION.
THE PROSPECT OF AUSTRALIA HAVING A
GOVERNMENT DECIDED BY DONKEYS IS DEPRESSING,
BUT ALL TOO CREDIBLE. RATHER THAN PANDERING TO THE
DONKEY VOTE, ALL PARTIES SHOULD COME TO AN
AGREEMENT TO NEUTRALISE IT. THE TASMANIANS HAVE
SHOWN THE WAY BY ROTATING THE CANDIDATES' NAMES
ON SEPARATE BATCHES OF BALLOT PAPERS. ONE BATCH
OF PAPERS WILL BE PRINTED LISTING ONE CANDIDATE
FIRST, AN EQUAL NUMBER WILL SHOW ANOTHER
CANDIDATE ON TOP, AN EQUAL NUMBER WILL HAVE A
THIRD, AND SO ON. THUS ALL SHARE THE DONKEY VOTE
EQUALLY, AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE RESULT IS NIL. THIS
LESSENS THE INFLUENCE OF PARTY HOW-TO-VOTE CARDS,
BUT VOTERS ARE NOT CONFUSED BY IT, BECAUSE THE
BALLOT PAPERS SHOW WHICH PARTY EACH CANDIDATE
BELONGS TO. FURTHERMORE, TASMANIAN VOTERS ARE
NOT REQUIRED TO ALLOCATE PREFERENCES BEYOND THE
NUMBER OF CANDIDATES TO BE ELECTED, SO THE
INFORMAL VOTE IS KEPT TO A MINIMUM.
THIS LAST REFORM IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE FOR
SENATE ELECTIONS. UNDER A LAW DISAPPROVED OF
BY THREE OUT OF FOUR AUSTRALIANS AND CONDEMNED
AS "QUITE RIDICULOUS" BY A FORMER CHIEF
ELECTORAL OFFICER, NO AUSTRALIAN'S VOTE FOR THE
SENATE IS COUNTED UNLESS THE VOTER HAS ALLOCATED
A PREFERENCE TO EVERY SINGLE CANDIDATE STANDING.
IN VICTORIA, WHERE 34 CANDIDATES STOOD, MORE
THAN 250,000 VOTES - 11.2 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL
 - HAVE THUS BEEN DECLARED INFORMAL. IN ALL,
ABOUT ONE IN 10 AUSTRALIAN VOTERS WAS
DISENFRANCHISED AT THE 18 OCTOBER SENATE
ELECTION BY THE COMPLEXITY OF THE VOTING SYSTEM.
IT IS A WEAKNESS FOR DEMOCRACY THAT WE ALLOW
THIS SYSTEM TO CONTINUE, WHEN SUCH A SIMPLE
REFORM COULD FIX IT. AN AGE POLL LAST YEAR
FOUND THAT 72 PER CENT OF AUSTRALIANS WANTED
PREFERENCES TO BE MADE OPTIONAL AT ELECTIONS, AND
THEY INCLUDED MAJORITIES OF VOTERS FROM ALL
PARTIES. THE FRASER GOVERNMENT SHOULD TRANSLATE
THEIR WISHES INTO ACTION.
<F40>
THURSDAY 6 NOVEMBER 1980
"THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY"
ALMOST NOBODY EXPECTED THAT RONALD REAGAN
WOULD WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BY AN
OVERWHELMING MARGIN, AND A FIRST REACTION MUST
BE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE VOTED FOR
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN A WAY THEY HAVE NOT
VOTED SINCE ROOSEVELT'S ELECTION IN 1932.
WHETHER THEY WILL GET IT IS ANOTHER MATTER.
THEY VOTED FOR NIXON, IT IS TRUE, IN 1968;
BUT NIXON HAD BEEN EISENHOWER'S VICE-
PRESIDENT, AT A TIME OF MODERATE POLICIES, AND
HE WAS ELECTED PARTLY BECAUSE HE SAID HE COULD
END THE WAR IN VIETNAM. EVEN SO, HE WON ONLY
A NARROW VICTORY OVER HUBERT HUMPHREY, A
CLASSIC AMERICAN LIBERAL DEMOCRAT. IN 1972,
AGAIN, THERE WERE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR
NIXON WAS RUNNING AGAINST ONE OF THE WEAKEST
CANDIDATES THE DEMOCRATS HAVE EVER RUN FOR
THE PRESIDENCY, SENATOR GEORGE MCGOVERN. AT
TUESDAY'S ELECTION, THE CHOICE WAS DIFFERENT.
GOVERNER REAGAN, WHATEVER ELSE MAY BE SAID
ABOUT HIM, HAS TAKEN OVER, FIRST CALIFORNIA, THEN
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND NOW THE NATION, AND
THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FREE WORLD, AS THE CLICHE
GOES, FROM A POLITICAL POSITION WELL TO THE RIGHT
OF THE TRADITIONAL, OLD-STYLE HEART OF THE
REPUBLICANS. HIS OUTSTANDING REPUBLICAN
PREDECESSOR AS GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, AFTER ALL,
WAS EARL WARREN.
MR REAGAN MAY HAVE WATERED DOWN OR
FOGGED SOME OF HIS EARLIER ATTITUDES, BUT THE
FACT REMAINS THAT HE HAS REPRESENTED A NEW
SUNBELT CONSERVATISM - QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE
OLD EAST-COAST REPUBLICANISM - WHOSE KNOW-
LEDGE OF THE WORLD IS SLIGHT, AND WHOSE
DECLARATIONS ON ALL PROBLEMS, WHETHER MORAL,
OR SOCIAL, OR INTERNATIONAL - INCLUDING QUESTIONS
OF PEACE OR WAR - HAVE INVARIABLY SHOWN AN
INAPPROPRIATE DEGREE OF CERTAINTY AND
DOGMATISM. IT HAS BEEN A POLITICAL MOVEMENT
THAT HAS TENDED TO LIVE ON SIMPLE SLOGANS. HAS
THE AMERICAN ELECTORATE NOW BOUGHT A DREAM
OF SIMPLE SOLUTIONS? IT SEEMS POSSIBLE. THEIR
OVERWHELMING VOTE FOR REAGAN CERTAINLY APPEARS
TO SHOW THAT WHAT THEY THINK THEY HAVE VOTED
FOR ARE SUCH THINGS AS "A STRONGER AMERICA",
"OLD VALUES", "STANDING UP TO COMMUNISM",
"LETTING PRIVATE ENTERPRISE GET ON WITH THE JOB",
AND OTHER REAGANITE PRESCRIPTIONS.
CYNICS WILL SAY, OF COURSE, THAT ANY RESULT
WAS POSSIBLE WHEN THE CHOICE WAS SO
UNPALATABLE. JIMMY CARTER HAD MUDDLED
THROUGH FOUR YEARS OF POWER IN A HAZE OF
INCONSISTENCY AND HESITATION, WHILE MR REAGAN,
NOT SO LONG AGO, HAD BEEN WIDELY REGARDED AS
THE UNTHINKABLE CANDIDATE. JUST A FEW WEEKS
FROM POLLING DAY, THE FORMER GOVERNOR WAS
MUSING ALOUD ABOUT THE CURATIVE POWERS OF
SMOG AND ATTACHING THE CHIEF BLAME FOR POLLUTION
TO TREES. THAT SAID, IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO
UNDERESTIMATE MR REAGAN. HE IS A FORMIDABLE
POLITICIAN. HE OUTLASTED AND OUTFOUGHT A HOST
OF YOUNGER MEN IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,
SURVIVED THE TIGHT-LIPPED SAVAGERY OF THAT
CONSUMMATE CAMPAIGNER JIMMY CARTER, AND USED
HIS HOLLYWOOD STAGE MANNER TO SUCH EFFECT
THAT HIS VISION SEEMED PLAUSIBLE. THERE WAS
INSPIRATION, HOWEVER GLIB IT MAY HAVE BEEN.
THE UNTHINKABLE BECAME THINKABLE.
THE RECIPE, OF COURSE, HAS A FAINTLY FAMILIAR
SMELL. MR CARTER TRIED SOME OF THE INGREDIENTS
HIMSELF. LOOK WHERE IT GOT HIM IN 1976, AND LOOK
WHERE IT HAS LEFT HIM NOW. THAT MAY NOT MATTER
TO MR REAGAN, WHO WILL BE 70 WHEN HE TAKES
THE OATH OF OFFICE AND WHO IS KNOWN TO HAVE
CONSIDERED SERVING ONLY ONE TERM. HE MAY NOT
BE AROUND IN 1984 TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE UNFULFILLED
DREAMS.
BUT FOR NOW, THE FORMER ACTOR IS ABOUT TO
START PLAYING HIS GREATEST ROLE. THE PART MAY
BE LADEN WITH RISK FOR ALL OF US, BUT THERE IS
REASON TO THINK THAT MR REAGAN MAY NOT BE
AS BAD AS HIS DETRACTORS WARN OR AS SOME OF HIS
LESS PROFOUND STATEMENTS SUGGEST. NEITHER WILL
HE BE AS GOOD AS HIS SUPPORTERS INSIST. LIKE MR
CARTER FOUR YEARS AGO, MR REAGAN IS THE NEW
BOY IN WASHINGTON, A STRANGER TO A SYSTEM THAT
HAS HUMBLED BETTER QUALIFIED PRESIDENTS. ALL WE
HAVE TO GO ON IS HIS RECORD IN THE GOVERNOR'S
MANSION IN SACRAMENTO AND, WHILE RUNNING
CALIFORNIA IS NOT QUITE THE SAME AS RUNNING THE
UNITED STATES AND THE WESTERN ALLIANCE, HIS TWO
TERMS PROVIDE SOME COMFORT.
WHILE BEHIND THE DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE
RHETORIC LIES A DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE MAN, MR
REAGAN'S LEGISLATIVE HISTORY IN THE RICHEST STATE
REVEALED A CAPACITY FOR COMPROMISE AND SOME
LIBERAL INITIATIVES. INDEED, AMONG THE MOST
WORRIED PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY MAY
WELL BE THOSE ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S EXTREME
RIGHT WING, WHO FOR WEEKS HAVE BEEN VOICING
THEIR FEAR OF A "SELL-OUT" SHOULD MR REAGAN WIN.
THE TRICK MAY BE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE POPULIST
FROM PACIFIC PALLISADES DOES, AND NOT WHAT HE
SAYS HE WILL DO.
IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, MR  REAGAN'S
LONG-STANDING ANIMOSITY TOWARDS COMMUNISM
AND HIS BELIEF THAT MILITARY MIGHT IS THE BEST
PROTECTION WILL GUIDE HIS THINKING. BUT HERE
AGAIN HIS DANGEROUSLY SIMPLE VISION MAY BE
TEMPERED AS IT IS TRANSLATED INTO ACTION. HE
TENDS TO START WITH THE BELIEF THAT CHANGE IS
DANGEROUS AND EVENTUALLY IS PERSUADED THAT IT
IS NECESSARY, AS HIS INITIAL OPPOSITION TO
RECOGNITION OF CHINA AND HIS SUBSEQUENT
ACCEPTANCE SHOW.
THUS IT MAY BE PREMATURE TO HARK BACK TO
THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION'S ATTACK ON MR
REAGAN AS THE CANDIDATE WHO REPRESENTED
DANGEROUSLY EXTREME AND SOMETIMES BIZARRE
POSITIONS. NOTHING MR REAGAN HAS DONE IN
PRACTICE JUSTIFIES THE PICTURE OF HIM AS A RIGID
REACTIONARY. EQUALLY, NOTHING HE HAS DONE
JUSTIFIES THE PROJECTION OF HIM AS A MAN EQUIPPED
FOR THE PRESIDENCY. DESPITE THE ENDLESS
CAMPAIGN, WE STILL DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH YET TO
BE SURE WHERE THE ACTOR AND THE CUE CARDS LEAVE
OFF AND WHERE THE POLITICAL LEADER TAKES OVER.
MUCH OF HIS PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND ON THE
CALIBRE OF THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE SURROUNDS
HIMSELF.
MR REAGAN IS NEITHER A FOOL - ALTHOUGH IT
MAY SEEM THAT WAY AT TIMES - NOR SENILE. BUT
THERE MUST BE SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER OR
NOT HE HAS THE BREADTH OF INTELLECT AND THE AGILITY
OF MIND TO COPE WITH THE MOST DEMANDING JOB
AVAILABLE. HE MAY, THOUGH, CONFOUND HIS CRITICS
AND SURPRISE US ALL. LET US HOPE HE DOES.
<F41>
MONDAY 10 NOVEMBER 1980
"POLICE INTEGRITY NEEDS SAFEGUARDS"
COMMANDER GORDON MARCHESI'S
COMMENTS ON THE LIMITATIONS OF THE POLICE
BUREAU OF INTERNAL INVESTIGATION (BII) ARE BOTH
HEARTENING AND DEPRESSING. IT IS HEARTENING THAT
A RECENTLY RETIRED SENIOR POLICE OFFICER SHOULD
OPENLY DECLARE THAT THE PROCEDURES FOR
INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS AGAINST POLICE ARE
INADEQUATE AND OFTEN FRUSTRATED BY THE TRIBAL
LOYALTIES OF THE POLICE FORCE, AND THAT HE SHOULD
RECOGNISE THE NECESSITY FOR INDEPENDENT
SUPERVISION OF SUCH INVESTIGATIONS. THE POLICE
ASSOCIATION, BY CONTRAST, HABITUALLY GIVES THE
IMPRESSION THAT THE FORCE IS COMPOSED
EXCLUSIVELY OF ANGELS IN BLUE, THAT ANY
COMPLAINTS AGAINST THEM ARE UNFOUNDED, AND
THAT ACCUSED POLICEMEN DESERVE THE FULL SUPPORT
OF THEIR FELLOWS. UNDERSTANDABLY, EVEN THE CHIEF
COMMISSIONER, MR MILLER, WHO REALISES THE
IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE
AND WHO IS DETERMINED TO HAVE A FORCE WORTHY
OF IT, OFTEN FEELS OBLIGED TO SPEAK OUT IN DEFENCE
OF HIS RANK AND FILE. MR MARCHESI'S REMARKS ARE
DEPRESSING, HOWEVER, IN THAT THEY SHOW LITTLE
HAS BEEN DONE TO REMEDY THE DEFICIENCIES TO
WHICH THE BEACH AND NORRIS REPORTS POINTED
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
AS A POLICEMAN FOR 40 YEARS AND HEAD OF
BII FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS, MR MARCHESI HAS
SPOKEN WITH INSIDE KNOWLEDGE AND AUTHORITY.
HE HAS IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS BOTH OF PRINCIPLE
AND PRACTICE. THERE IS THE AGE-OLD PROBLEM OF
WHO IS TO WATCH OVER THE WATCHDOGS. IDEALLY,
THERE SHOULD BE NO NEED FOR SUCH A SECTION AS
BII. MOST POLICE, AS MR MARCHESI POINTS OUT,
ARE HONEST, CONSCIENTIOUS AND CONSIDERATE OF
CITIZENS' RIGHTS. BUT SOME ARE NOT. MORE THAN
MOST OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIALS, POLICE ARE EXPOSED
TO TEMPTATIONS TO DISHONESTY, CORRUPTION AND
ABUSE OF THEIR POWER. THEY ARE ALSO, BY THE
NATURE OF THEIR DUTIES, VULNERABLE TO FALSE
ACCUSATION. IT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT
COMPLAINTS AGAINST THEM BE PROPERLY
INVESTIGATED, AND SEEN TO BE SO. OBVIOUSLY,
POLICE ARE BEST EQUIPPED BY TRAINING AND
EXPERIENCE FOR SUCH INVESTIGATIVE WORK. BUT IF
THE PUBLIC IS TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN INTERNAL
INVESTIGATIONS THEY MUST BE SUBJECT TO APPEAL
AND SUPERVISION BY AN INDEPENDENT, PUBLIC
AUTHORITY. A FORMER OVERSEER OF INVESTIGATIONS
 - A RETIRED MAGISTRATE - HAS NOT BEEN REPLACED
SINCE HE RETIRED IN 1978. THERE IS A LIMITED
AVENUE OF APPEAL TO THE OMBUDSMAN, WHO IS
BUSY ENOUGH WITH HIS OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES, AND
MORE THAN 2000 COMPLAINTS MADE SINCE 1976
HAVE NOT BEEN REVIEWED. MR MARCHESI'S CALL FOR
A PUBLIC TRIBUNAL TO OVERSEE BII'S WORK IS ONE
THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD URGENTLY HEED.
THEN THERE ARE THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES.
THE BUREAU IS UNDERMANNED - MR MARCHESI
BELIEVES IT SHOULD HAVE 35 TO 40 OFFICERS INSTEAD
OF ITS PRESENT STRENGTH OF 11 - AND MANY
INVESTIGATIONS ARE EITHER HANDED OVER TO OTHER
POLICE OR DEALT WITH TOO LATE. PEOPLE WHO WISH
TO MAKE A CONFIDENTIAL COMPLAINT TO BII HAVE TO
SIGN A BOOK IN THE FOYER OF THE WILLIAM STREET
POLICE HEADQUARTERS, AND FILES RECORDING PUBLIC
COMPLAINTS ARE NOT KEPT SUFFICIENTLY SECURE.
MR MILLER HAS SAID THAT THE STRENGTH OF BII
CANNOT BE INCREASED UNTIL A SEPARATE BUILDING
WITH MORE SPACE IS FOUND. SUCH ACCOMMODATION
MAY NOT BE EASY TO FIND, AS HE SAYS, BUT THE
QUEST SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE URGENT PRIORITY BY
THE GOVERNMENT. THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE IS
PROBABLY WHAT THE BEACH REPORT APTLY DESCRIBED
AS THE "BROTHERHOOD SYNDROME" - THE SELF-
PROTECTIVE SOLIDARITY AMONG POLICE WHICH SHIELDS
THOSE WHO BREAK THE RULES AND IMPEDES
INVESTIGATION AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, EFFECTIVE
REMEDIES. POLICE MUST REALISE THAT THEIR GREATEST
ASSET IS PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND CO-OPERATION,
AND THAT THIS CANNOT BE ENSURED SO LONG AS
THEY REFRAIN FROM HELPING TO WEED OUT THE SMALL
MINORITY AMONG THEM WHO BESMIRCH THE
INTEGRITY OF THE FORCE.
"INDIA AND MRS GANDHI"
NEARLY A YEAR AGO MRS GANDHI OF INDIA
MADE ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE
RETURNS TO POWER IN MEMORY. THE PRIME
MINISTER WHO HAD GIVEN HER PEOPLE
FORCED STERILISATION, DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL,
POLICE REPRESSION, CENSORSHIP AND DENIAL OF
PERSONAL FREEDOMS SWEPT BACK TO OFFICE ON A
PROMISE OF LAW AND ORDER AND AN END TO
COMMUNAL STRIFE. IT WAS A PROMISE THE
DISCORDANT AND DIVISIVE JANATA COALITION FAILED
TO OFFER. LEADERSHIP AND ASSURANCE WERE THE
OVERRIDING ISSUES. AND MRS GANDHI, THE
UNASHAMED AUTOCRAT, COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
BETTER ATTUNED TO THE DESPERATE NEED FOR
POLITICAL COHESION IN A COUNTRY WHERE MANY
SEEM CONVINCED THAT A DEGREE OF
AUTHORITARIANISM IS NECESSARY FOR EFFECTIVE
GOVERNMENT. IN THE 10 MONTHS SINCE HER
RETURN, HOWEVER, MRS GANDHI HAS NOT BEEN HER
OLD SELF AS A SYMBOL OF POWER AND
LEADERSHIP.
INDIA APPEARS TO BE ADRIFT IN A SEA OF
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ILLS IN WHICH CRIME,
COMMUNAL VIOLENCE AND POLICE BRUTALITY ARE
THRIVING. THE DROUGHT HAS BEEN THE WORST THIS
CENTURY. INFLATION IS HIGH AND IMPLACABLE. OIL
IMPORTS NOW CONSUME 60 PER CENT OF EXPORT
EARNINGS. POWER BREAKDOWNS OCCUR DAILY.
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IS FALLING AND 25 MILLION
PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED. SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS
WERE INHERITED FROM THE JANATA YEARS. BUT, IN
THE FACE OF ALL THIS, NEW DELHI SEEMS TO BE
PARALYSED, UNABLE TO DEAL WITH DAY TO DAY
PROBLEMS AND DEMORALISED BY LACK OF POLITICAL
VISION AND WILL. MRS GANDHI'S PERSONAL
LEADERSHIP IS BEING QUESTIONED OPENLY FOR THE
FIRST TIME AS MILLIONS LOOK AT THE SWAGGERING
YOUNGSTERS WHO RECEIVED THE VOTES CAST FOR
HER.
THESE NEW POLITICIANS WERE CHOSEN BY THE
PRIME MINISTER'S SON SANJAY, WHO WAS ALSO HER
CLOSEST POLITICAL ADVISER, AND OCCUPY 60 PER CENT
OF THE INDIRA CONGRESS'S SEATS IN THE ASSEMBLY.
THEIR ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM IS EDGED BY A
CONTEMPT FOR THE INSTITUTIONS OF POLITICAL LIFE IN
WHICH PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS CAN BE
BROUGHT TO A HALT BY ORGANISED BARRACKING.
POLICEMEN CAN BE BOUGHT, OR THREATENED.
DEMONSTRATIONS CAN BE STAGED IN COURT, AND
JUDGES PILLORIED. NO ATTEMPT IS MADE TO HIDE
THE STYLE, OR TO REASSURE INDIANS THAT THE
ENORMITY AND COMPLEXITY OF THEIR PROBLEMS ARE
UNDERSTOOD. THE PARTY IS IN DISARRAY NOW THAT
SANJAY IS DEAD. HE WAS THE IRON FIST THAT KEPT
THE RULING POLITICIANS IN LINE. MRS GANDHI HAS
BEEN UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PULL THEM
TOGETHER AGAIN, SHOWING A DISINCLINATION TO
APPOINT NEW CABINET MEMBERS AND HOLDING FOR
HERSELF NOT ONLY THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP BUT
ALSO THE MINISTRIES OF DEFENCE, INDUSTRY, STEEL,
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.
CYNICS HAVE BEEN HEARD TO SAY THAT SHE
HAD ONLY TWO AIMS IN RUNNING FOR OFFICE AGAIN.
ONE WAS TO VINDICATE HERSELF AFTER THE
HUMILIATION OF THE 1977 DEFEAT. THE OTHER WAS
TO ENSURE THAT SANJAY, WHO WAS BLAMED FOR
MANY OF THE EMERGENCY'S EXCESSES, WOULD
SUCCEED HER AND KEEP ALIVE THE NEHRU DYNASTY
THAT HAS RULED INDIA FOR MOST OF ITS INDEPENDENT
LIFE. NOW, ACCORDING TO THIS THEORY, MRS GANDHI
HAS NO REASON TO GOVERN. ANOTHER THEORY
ADVANCED BY SOME OF HER OPPONENTS HOLDS THAT
SHE IS USING THE COUNTRY'S PARALYSIS AND DRIFT
TO PROVIDE AN EXCUSE TO DECLARE AN
EMERGENCY SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN WHICH SHE
PREVIOUSLY RAN INDIA WITHOUT THE TRAMMELS OF
DEMOCRATIC TRADITION. THE TRICK HERE, IT IS SAID,
IS TO LET THINGS DRIFT UNTIL THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
CLAMOR FOR THE WHIP HAND.
WHATEVER THE TRUTH, INDIA'S FUTURE IS
OMINOUS. AS AUSTRALIA'S HIGH COMMISSIONER IN
NEW DELHI, MR UPTON, WROTE IN A RECENT
DISPATCH, "THE CONTINUING ABSENCE OF AN
EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION COMBINED WITH THE ENDEMIC
WEAKNESSES OF THE CONGRESS (I) LEADERSHIP ADDS
UP TO A DISTURBING PICTURE FOR THE FUTURE OF
THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF INDIAN DEMOCRACY". MR
UPTON DECLINED TO RULE OUT IN THE LONGER TERM
THE POSSIBILITY OF A MILITARY TAKEOVER. OTHER
CRITICS OF MRS GANDHI FORECAST THAT SHE IS
PREPARING TO REPLACE THE WESTMINSTER-STYLE
PARLIAMENT AND SET HERSELF UP AS AN ALL-POWERFUL
PRESIDENT. THEY POINT OUT THAT THE PRIME
MINISTER HAS CALLED A NATIONAL DEBATE ON THE
BEST WAY TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY. THEY CITE A
STRING OF ORDINANCES ISSUED IN THE PAST TWO
MONTHS TO PROVIDE NEW POWERS OF PREVENTIVE
DETENTION AND CENSORSHIP. THERE IS A GROWING
TENDENCY TO RULE BY EDICT. PERHAPS MRS GANDHI
IS WAKING FROM THE SLEEP OF HER EMOTIONAL
AND POLITICAL DEPRESSION.
<F42>
TUESDAY 11 NOVEMBER 1980
"THE QUEENSLAND ELECTION"
IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE ANY STATE ELECTION HAS
CAUGHT THE INTEREST OF AUSTRALIANS
GENERALLY AS MUCH AS THE COMING QUEENSLAND
ELECTION. THE REASON FOR THIS IS PLAIN: THE MOST
CONTROVERSIAL AND SEEMINGLY UNBEATABLE
GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA IS AT LAST IN DANGER OF
BEING BROUGHT DOWN - FROM WITHIN. AFTER 44
YEARS IN WHICH IT MEEKLY ACCEPTED THE ROLE OF
JUNIOR PARTNER IN QUEENSLAND'S CONSERVATIVE
COALITION, THE LIBERAL PARTY HAS FINALLY FOUND
THE COURAGE TO TRY TO TAKE OVER LEADERSHIP OF
THE GOVERNMENT FROM MR JOH BJELKE-PETERSEN.
THE LIBERALS HAVE NOMINATED CANDIDATES IN
MANY OF THE NATIONAL PARTY SEATS, AND IN SEVEN
OF THEM THEY STAND A GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING.
IF THEY CAN GAIN SIX OF THEM - OR HOLD THEIR
GROUND AGAINST LABOR BETTER THAN THE
NATIONALS DO - QUEENSLAND WILL HAVE ITS FIRST
CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT IN 23 YEARS.
IN OTHER COALITIONS, PERHAPS, A TRANSFER OF
THE LEADING ROLE MAY NOT SIGNIFY MUCH CHANGE
IN POLICY. IN QUEENSLAND, THE DIFFERENCES ARE
LIKELY TO BE PROFOUND. UNDER THE BJELKE-
PETERSEN GOVERNMENT, QUEENSLAND HAS BECOME
NOTORIOUS FOR REPRESSIVE SOCIAL LEGISLATION,
AUTHORITARIAN ADMINISTRATION AND CAVALIER
MISUSE OF PUBLIC FUNDS AND POSITIONS OF OFFICE.
WE HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS SCANDALS INVOLVING
LAND REZONINGS. STREET MARCHES HAVE BEEN
BANNED, A VITAL ABORIGINAL HEALTH PROGRAMME
SUDDENLY BLOCKED, ONE OF BRISBANE'S MOST
BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS WANTONLY DESTROYED, THE
POLICE GIVEN VIRTUALLY UNCHECKED POWER,
ABORIGINES DENIED LAND RIGHTS, AND GOVERNMENT
FUNDS AND POWERS USED FOR POLITICAL ENDS. MOST
OF THESE ACTS HAVE RESULTED FROM THE NATIONAL
PARTY'S DOMINATION OF THE RULING COALITION.
MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY OPPOSED BY
LIBERAL BACKBENCHERS AND THEIR PARTY
ORGANISATION. IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT A LIBERAL-LED
QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT WOULD BE MORE
LIBERAL, MORE HUMANE AND MORE ETHICAL IN
OFFICE THAN THE BJELKE-PETERSEN REGIME.
THE ODDS AGAINST THE LIBERAL CHALLENGE
SUCCEEDING, HOWEVER, ARE FORMIDABLE. UNDER THE
QUEENSLAND GERRYMANDER, COUNTRY ELECTORATES
HAVE BARELY 11,000 VOTERS WHILE URBAN
ELECTORATES AVERAGE 17,500. THE RESULT OF THIS
DISTORTION IS THAT THE COUNTRY-BASED NATIONAL
PARTY HAS 35 SEATS IN THE PARLIAMENT, WHILE THE
CITY-BASED LIBERALS HAVE ONLY 24 - DESPITE THE
FACT THAT THEY RECEIVED A ROUGHLY SIMILAR
NUMBER OF VOTES AT THE LAST ELECTION. THUS THE
LIBERALS WILL HAVE TO OUTPOLL THE NATIONALS
DECISIVELY TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF MATCHING THEIR
SWAG OF SEATS.
THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE LIBERALS ARE
LIMITED. THEIR DOCILE ACCEPTANCE OF THE JUNIOR
ROLE FOR SO LONG HAS MEANT THAT THEY HAVE
ALMOST NO PRESENCE IN MOST OF RURAL
QUEENSLAND, AND LITTLE OR NO CHANCE OF WINNING
ANY RURAL SEATS. THEIR PROSPECTS ARE CONFINED
TO SEVEN NATIONAL PARTY SEATS: THREE ON THE
OUTSKIRTS OF BRISBANE, TWO ON THE GOLD COAST -
INCLUDING THE SEAT OF THE AUTHORITARIAN MINISTER
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, MR RUSSELL HINZE -
AND ONE EACH IN TOWNSVILLE AND TOOWOOMBA.
AGAINST THIS, HOWEVER, THE LIBERALS THEMSELVES
ARE UNDER THREAT IN EIGHT BRISBANE SEATS FROM
LABOR, AND THE BEST THEY CAN HOPE IS THAT THE
NATIONALS WILL LOSE A COUPLE MORE SEATS TO
LABOR THAN THEY DO. ON TOP OF THIS, LABOR HAS
NOW MISCHIEVOUSLY DIRECTED PREFERENCES TO THE
NATIONALS IN THE TWO LIBERAL-HELD SEATS ON THE
GOLD COAST, SO THAT ANY LIBERAL GAINS MAY WELL
BE OFFSET BY LOSSES.
LABOR HAS BECOME THE FORGOTTEN PARTY OF
THIS THREE-CORNERED ELECTION, AND WITH GOOD
REASON: THEY HAVE NO HOPE OF WINNING IT. LABOR
HAS ONLY 23 SEATS IN THE 82-MEMBER PARLIAMENT,
AND WOULD NEED A SWING OF ALMOST 6 PER CENT
TO GAIN POWER. THE FAILURE OF THE PARTY TO
SETTLE ITS INTERNAL CONFLICTS HAS PUT PAID TO ANY
THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE LABOR'S YEAR, QUITE
APART FROM THE FACT THAT ITS LEADER, MR ED
CASEY, IS PLAINLY OUT OF HIS DEPTH IN THE JOB.
THE RECENT FEDERAL ELECTION RESULTS CONFIRMED
THAT THE BEST LABOR CAN HOPE FOR IS TO MAKE
SUBSTANTIAL GAINS FROM THE COALITION - AND THIS
IS QUITE POSSIBLE, SINCE IT LOST SIX SEATS AT THE
LAST ELECTION BY LESS THAN 1 PER CENT - AND
PUT ITSELF IN A POSITION TO MAKE ITS REAL BID
FOR POWER AT THE 1983 ELECTION. BY THEN,
PERHAPS, WITH A NEW LEADER, A SOLUTION TO ITS
INTERNECINE FIGHTING AND A BETTER-QUALIFIED
CAUCUS, IT WILL BE READY TO INHERIT THE
GOVERNMENT.
ELECTIONS ARE OFTEN A KIND OF CHOICE
BETWEEN EVILS - AND THIS ONE MORE THAN MOST.
WHILE MR BJELKE-PETERSEN HAS BEEN RELATIVELY
RESTRAINED SINCE THE DEFEAT OF HIS ABORTION BILL
LAST MAY - WHEN THE BULK OF THE LIBERAL MPS
CROSSED THE FLOOR TO VOTE WITH LABOR - HIS
ELECTION PLEDGE TO INTRODUCE SCHOOL COURSES
DESIGNED "TO ENCOURAGE A GREATER AWARENESS AND
UNDERSTANDING OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND ITS ROLE
IN SOCIETY" INDICATES THAT QUEENSLANDERS CAN
EXPECT MORE OF THE SAME IF HE IS RETURNED TO
POWER. BY CONTRAST, THE LIBERAL LEADER, DR LLEW
EDWARDS, HAS PLEDGED SOME STEPS TO REFORM
QUEENSLAND POLITICS, SUCH AS A CODE OF ETHICS FOR
MINISTERS, A REGISTER OF POLITICIANS' PECUNIARY
INTERESTS, A PRIVACY COMMITTEE, MORE EMPHASIS
ON INDUSTRIAL CONCILIATION AND A FAIR ELECTORAL
REDISTRIBUTION. CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY OF DR
EDWARDS AND HIS MINISTERS TO  RESTORE
CONFIDENCE IN THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT
WOULD BE GREATER IF THEY HAD SHOWN MORE
SPUNK IN STANDING UP TO MR BJELKE-PETERSEN IN
THE PAST. AS IT IS, HOWEVER, THEY SEEM THE
LESSER EVIL - BUT ALSO THE LIKELY LOSERS.
<F43>
WEDNESDAY 12 NOVEMBER 1980
"HAYDEN LEADS A STRONG TEAM"
THE LEADER OF THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENTARY
LABOR PARTY IS BY TRADITIONAL PARTY RULE
AT A DISADVANTAGE IN COMPARISON WITH HIS LIBERAL
COUNTERPART. A LIBERAL LEADER, WHETHER HE BE
PRIME MINISTER OR OPPOSITION LEADER, IS ENTITLED
TO CHOOSE THE MEMBERS OF HIS MINISTRY OR
SHADOW MINISTRY (ALTHOUGH, IF IN COALITION, HE IS
OBLIGED TO ACCEPT THE NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY'S
NOMINEES FOR ITS QUOTA OF FRONT-BENCHERS). THE
LABOR FRONT BENCH, HOWEVER, IS ELECTED BY THE
PARTY CAUCUS, AND THE LEADER'S PREROGATIVE IS
LIMITED TO ALLOTTING PORTFOLIOS. ON THIS OCCASION,
THE LABOR CAUCUS HAS ELECTED A WELL-BALANCED
TEAM, DROPPING SOME MEMBERS IN WHOM IT HAD
LOST CONFIDENCE (IN SOME CASES WITH GOOD
REASON) AND BRINGING IN SOME WELCOME NEW
BLOOD. AND MR HAYDEN HAS ALLOCATED THE
SHADOW PORTFOLIOS TO THE BEST EFFECT.
MR BOWEN NATURALLY REMAINS DEPUTY LEADER
AND IS A REASONABLE CHOICE AS SHADOW FOREIGN
AFFAIRS MINISTER OPPOSITE MR STREET. SENATOR
BUTTON, ONE OF THE PARTY'S MORE ASTUTE,
PERSONABLE AND THOUGHTFUL POLITICIANS, DESERVED
TO SUCCEED UNOPPOSED TO THE SENATE LEADERSHIP.
HE IS ONE OF LABOR'S FEW TOP REPRESENTATIVES
WITH A NON-METROPOLITAN BACKGROUND AND SHOULD
BE AN EFFECTIVE SPOKESMAN ON COMMUNICATIONS,
ALTHOUGH THE MINISTER, MR SINCLAIR, IS NOT IN
THE SAME CHAMBER. THE ONLY CONTEST FOR THE
TOP POSITIONS WAS FOR THE PARTY'S DEPUTY
LEADERSHIP IN THE SENATE. THERE WAS SOME
DIVISION ON PARTY LINES, BUT THE BETTER MAN,
SENATOR GRIMES, WON AND WILL AGAIN BE AN ABLE
SPOKESMAN ON SOCIAL SECURITY. MR HAWKE DID
NOT POLL AS HIGHLY AS HE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED -
AND THERE IS STILL SOME CAUCUS RESENTMENT AT
HIS IMPATIENT AMBITIONS - BUT HE WILL COVER
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, AS FORESHADOWED, AS WELL AS
THE RELATED FIELDS OF EMPLOYMENT AND YOUTH
AFFAIRS. THAT HE SHOULD BE PITTED AGAINST MR
PEACOCK, THE PRINCIPAL CONTENDER FOR THE LIBERAL
SUCCESSION, WILL ADD PIQUANCY TO HIS
PARLIAMENTARY PERFORMANCE.
AS INDUSTRIAL AFFAIRS AND EMPLOYMENT
SPOKESMAN, MR HAWKE REPLACES MR. YOUNG,
WHOSE STANDING IN THE PARTY AND IN MR HAYDEN'S
ESTEEM HAS UNDERSTANDABLY FALLEN, AND WHO HAS
BEEN DEMOTED TO IMMIGRATION. MR KEATING ON
ENERGY AND RESOURCES, DR BLEWETT ON HEALTH,
SENATOR EVANS ON LAW AND MR JONES ON
TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE COULD WELL OUTCLASS THE
MINISTERS OPPOSITE. SENATOR EVANS, WITH HIS
INTEREST AND EXPERTISE IN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND
LAW REFORM, SHOULD BE AN ADMIRABLE SHADOW
ATTORNEY-GENERAL. MR WILLIS WILL CONCENTRATE ON
TREASURY AFFAIRS WHILE SENATOR WALSH, ONE OF
LABOR'S FEW ECONOMIC RATIONALISTS, TAKES OVER
RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCE, TRADE AND NATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT. MR KERIN, A FORMER AGRICULTURAL
ECONOMIST, IS A GOOD CHOICE IN PRIMARY INDUSTRY,
AND WILL FRIGHTEN THE FARMERS LESS THAN SENATOR
WALSH DID.
MR HAYDEN HAS AS GOOD A FRONT BENCH AS
COULD BE CHOSEN. HIS HOPE, AND THE LABOR
PARTY'S, NOW MUST BE THAT IT WILL WORK TOGETHER
AS AN EFFECTIVE TEAM, PUTTING LEADERSHIP
RIVALRIES AND FACTIONAL SQUABBLES ASIDE IN THE
COMMON CAUSE OF CHALLENGING THE GOVERNMENT
AND APPEARING AS A CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE FOR THE
FUTURE.
"THE WATCHDOG THAT WHISPERS"
FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
PROTECTION AUTHORITY IN 1972, THERE HAS BEEN
SOME CONFUSION WITHIN THE EPA ITSELF AND THE
WIDER COMMUNITY ABOUT ITS INTENDED ROLE. ON
THE ONE HAND, THE EPA HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO
THE PUBLIC AS A SORT OF DETECTIVE AGENCY OF
EXPERTS WHO SWOOP IN ON OFFENSIVE SMOKESTACKS
AND LIQUID WASTE DISCHARGES AND HAUL POLLUTERS
INTO COURTS TO STOP THEM FOULING OUR AIR AND
WATER. IN SOME AREAS, THE EPA HAS, INDEED,
FUNCTIONED THIS WAY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EPA AND
ITS AGENCIES HAVE PROSECUTED COMPANIES AND
INDIVIDUALS ON 707 CHARGES ALLEGING WATER
POLLUTION IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. BUT MOSTLY THE
EPA HAS, IN FACT, ADOPTED THE ROLE OF A
GOVERNMENT ADVISORY SERVICE, OF AN AGENCY THAT
SEEKS TO NEGOTIATE WITH POLLUTERS AND PERSUADE
THEM TO CLEAN UP THEIR DISCHARGES RATHER THAN
USE THE FORMIDABLE LEGISLATIVE WEAPONS AT ITS
DISPOSAL. IN THAT SAME FIVE-YEAR PERIOD, FOR
INSTANCE, THE EPA FILED ONLY 21 CHARGES INVOLVING
AIR POLLUTION. SOMETIMES THE IRON GLOVE OF THE
LAW SEEMS VERY SOFT.
JUST HOW SOFT WAS SHOWN LAST SATURDAY BY
'THE AGE' INSIGHT INVESTIGATION OF AIR POLLUTION
CONTROL. THE EPA CARRIES OUT HARDLY ANY
INDEPENDENT TEST OF ITS OWN ON FACTORY
CHIMNEYS TO CHECK WHETHER ITS POLLUTION CONTROLS
ARE BEING OBSERVED. IN THE PAST FINANCIAL YEAR
IT CHECKED ONLY 17 IN THE WHOLE STATE. OTHERWISE,
IT RELIES ON THE COMPANIES TO MONITOR THEIR OWN
EMISSIONS AND PRESENT IT WITH THE RESULTS. IT IS
INEVITABLE THAT UNDER SUCH A SYSTEM THE EPA
RARELY PROSECUTES ANYONE FOR BREACHING THE
CONDITIONS OF THEIR WASTE DISCHARGE LICENCE,
DESPITE THE FACT THAT EVERYONE KNOWS SUCH
BREACHES DO OCCUR. NOR CAN IT RELEASE DETAILS OF
THIS SELF-MONITORING WITHOUT THE COMPANY'S
CONSENT - WHICH WOULD NOT BE GIVEN IF THE TESTS
DISCLOSED ANYTHING DAMAGING. THUS RESIDENTS
AFFECTED BY FOUL AIR EMISSIONS ARE UNABLE TO FIND
OUT WHAT THE COMPANY IS DISCHARGING AND
WHETHER IT IS WITHIN THE LAW.
ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THE EPA WANTING TO
LEAVE THE BURDEN OF ROUTINE TESTING TO THE
COMPANIES THEMSELVES; SPOT TESTING IS EXPENSIVE
AND THE EPA IS NOT SUFFERING FROM EXCESSIVE
FUNDS. BUT IT MUST BE ASKED WHETHER OUR AIR
POLLUTION CONTROL IS EFFECTIVE WHEN WE HAVE
VIRTUALLY NO INDEPENDENT CHECK ON WHAT FACTORIES
ARE PUTTING INTO OUR AIR. THE CASES OF THE
NYLEX PLANT AT MENTONE AND THE KEMREZ
CHEMICALS PLANT IN CHELTENHAM, DOCUMENTED IN
OUR INSIGHT ARTICLE, SUGGEST THAT IT IS NOT.
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT DANGEROUS CHEMICALS ARE
BEING EMITTED AT BOTH FACTORIES WITHOUT EITHER
HAVING A LICENCE TO DO SO.
THE EPA MAY BE RIGHT IN INSISTING THAT ITS
LENGTHY PROCESS OF LICENCE REVIEWS AND
NEGOTIATION WITH THE FIRMS CONCERNED WILL SOLVE
THE PROBLEMS EVENTUALLY. BUT IF IT IS TO HAVE
ANY CLOUT WITH THE LICENCE HOLDERS, IT MUST BE
ABLE TO CARRY OUT ITS OWN TESTS WHEN NECESSARY
AND BE PREPARED TO PUBLISH ITS RESULTS AND
PROSECUTE. TO DO THIS, IT WOULD NEED FAR MORE
PEOPLE THAN ITS PRESENT THREE-MEMBER
SMOKESTACK INVESTIGATING TEAM. BUT THIS MUST
BE DONE. WE NEED A WATCHDOG THAT CAN DO
MORE THAN JUST WHISPER IN THE BURGLAR'S EAR.
<F44>
THURSDAY 13 NOVEMBER 1980
"LEFT WITH MR FOOT"
MR MICHAEL FOOT, A MAN OF THE PAST IF
EVER THERE WAS ONE, HAS BEEN CHOSEN TO
LEAD THE BRITISH LABOR PARTY INTO A FUTURE
FILLED WITH DOUBTS, DISTRACTIONS AND DANGERS.
LABOR TODAY IS A VERY DIFFERENT PARTY. IT HAS
GONE LEFT WITH ASTONISHING SPEED. ITS NEW
AND RADICAL MANIFESTO, RUSHED THROUGH THE
RECENT BLACKPOOL CONFERENCE BY MR TONY BENN,
COMMITS BRITAIN UNDER A LABOR GOVERNMENT TO
A RASH OF NATIONALISATION AND A RUSH TO SCRAP
EVERYTHING FROM PRIVATE EDUCATION AND THE
HOUSE OF LORDS TO MEMBERSHIP OF THE EEC;
PERHAPS EVEN NATO. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE
LEFT HAS CAPTURED THE CONSTITUENCIES, SOME OF
THE MORE SIGNIFICANT UNIONS, AND THUS THE PARTY
MACHINE, MUST RAISE SERIOUS DOUBTS AS TO
WHETHER LABOR ANY LONGER CAN CLAIM TO BE
REPRESENTATIVE.
THE VAST MAJORITY OF LABOR VOTERS WOULD
APPEAR TO BE MODERATE AND REFORMIST WITH
ESSENTIALLY SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC VALUES. PARTIES
WHICH CEASE TO BE REPRESENTATIVE GIVE WAY TO
NEW POLITICAL ALIGNMENTS. AND LABOR IS NO
EXCEPTION. ADMITTEDLY, ITS HAND IS BEING FORCED.
MR FOOT MAY WELL BE THE LAST LEADER TO BE
ELECTED BY THE PARLIAMENTARIANS ALONE. THAT
PRIVILEGE IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF A DEBATE FROM
WHICH THE UNIONS AND THE CONSTITUENCY ACTIVISTS
HOPE TO ACHIEVE SOME SORT OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
SO THE PARTY AS A WHOLE IS IN A FRIGHTFUL MESS.
MR CALLAGHAN, A MODERATELY SUCCESSFUL PRIME
MINISTER WAS NOT MUCH GOOD AS LEADER OF THE
OPPOSITION. HE MUST TAKE HIS SHARE OF THE BLAME
FOR THE STATE OF THE PARTY TODAY.
IF HE SEEMED TO JUMP SHIP AT A SINGULARLY
INOPPORTUNE TIME, MR CALLAGHAN PROBABLY
BELIEVED IT WAS THE BEST WAY TO HELP MR DENIS
HEALEY'S PURSUIT OF THE INTERIM LEADERSHIP BEFORE
A NEW ELECTORAL SYSTEM COULD BE INTRODUCED.
THE MODERATES' GAMBIT FAILED, ALTHOUGH ONLY BY
10 VOTES. SO NOW WE HAVE MR FOOT IN CHARGE,
WITH HIS NOTABLE PAST AS A LEFT-WING RHETORICIAN.
HE IS NOT AN OUT-AND-OUT RADICAL LIKE MR BENN,
WHICH IS A REASON WHY THE LEFT, KNOWING THAT
MR BENN COULD NOT WIN THROUGH IN THE
PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM, DECIDED TO DRAFT HIM. MR
FOOT MAY NOW SEE HIMSELF AS A LONG-TERM LEADER,
BUT THAT WAS NOT WHY HE WAS TALKED INTO
RUNNING. HIS ELECTION THIS WEEK MAKES MORE
LIKELY THE ELECTION OF MR BENN.
OF COURSE MR FOOT IS A DECENT AND CHARMING
MAN, A SPLENDID ORATOR WITH A SOLID CONCERN FOR
THE UNDERDOG, A THEORIST OF LIBERTARIAN PRINCIPLES
AND A GREAT BELIEVER IN THE WORTH AND TRADITIONS
OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. THESE ARE
COMMENDABLE QUALITIES, BUT THEY ARE HARDLY THE
STUFF REQUIRED TO LEAD EITHER THE PARTY OR THE
COUNTRY. MR FOOT IS TOO NICE AND AGREEABLE A
MAN TO HEAD A PARTY WHICH, ABOVE ALL AT THIS
TIME OF TRAVAIL, NEEDS A LEADER OF STRENGTH AND
VITALITY. HE IS POPULAR WITH SOME OF THE MORE
LEFT-WING UNIONS. MR FOOT IS PLEDGED TO POLICIES
THAT COULD BE DISASTROUS FOR THE BRITISH ECONOMY
AND THE WESTERN ALLIANCE. AS A MINISTER HE WAS
INDIFFERENT TO DEPARTMENTAL DETAIL AND DISCIPLINE.
AS A POTENTIAL PRIME MINISTER, HE IS IMPLAUSIBLE.
CYNICS WOULD SAY THAT HE IS MRS THATCHER'S
IDEA OF A LABOR LEADER, FOR HE IS CERTAINLY AN
INSURANCE POLICY AGAINST CONSERVATIVE DEFEAT IN
1983 OR 1984.
MR FOOT IS 67 NOW AND MAY WELL BE TOO OLD.
HIS HEALTH IS NOT AS ROBUST AS THAT OF
PRESIDENT-ELECT REAGAN. HE IS AN INDULGENCE FOR
A PARTY THAT SEEMS TO BE INDULGING ITSELF AT EVERY
TURN. AS IT IS, MR FOOT IS THE CHOICE MOST LIKELY
TO SPLIT LABOR BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION. A SOCIAL
DEMOCRATIC PARTY COULD BE BORN FROM THE LABOR
MODERATES AND THE LIBERALS. IF THE LABOR PARTY
IS NO LONGER REPRESENTATIVE, A NEW PARTY IN THE
CENTRE MIGHT FIND READY AND SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT.
THE DISTURBING THING ABOUT MR FOOT'S ELECTION
IS THAT IT COMPLETES THE POLARISATION OF BRITISH
POLITICS. THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS LED FROM THE
RIGID RIGHT, THE LABOR PARTY FROM THE DOGMATIC
LEFT.
"THE BALANCE OF POWER"
THE SENATE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE HANDS OF
THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS IS LIKELY TO
IRRITATE RATHER THAN SERIOUSLY IMPEDE THE FRASER
GOVERNMENT, AND MAY EVEN IMPROVE THE QUALITY
OF PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW. OWING TO THE
PECULIARITIES OF THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION, THE
GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LOSE CONTROL OF THE SENATE
UNTIL 1 JULY, WHEN THE SENATORS ELECTED ON 18
OCTOBER TAKE THEIR PLACES. THIS GIVES THE
GOVERNMENT AMPLE TIME TO PUSH THROUGH
LEGISLATION WHICH IT THINKS THAT SENATOR CHIPP'S
BAND OF FIVE - OR SIX IF THE DEMOCRATS WIN THE
FIFTH CONTESTED SEAT IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA ON A
RECOUNT - MIGHT JOIN THE LABOR PARTY IN
OPPOSING.
FROM 1 JULY, THE FRASER GOVERNMENT WILL
FIND ITSELF IN A SITUATION WITH WHICH THE MENZIES,
GORTON AND MCMAHON GOVERNMENTS MANAGED TO
COPE DURING PART OF THEIR LIFETIMES. IN SOME
WAYS, THE DEMOCRATS MAY BE LESS TROUBLESOME
THAN THE DEMOCRATIC LABOR PARTY WAS WHEN IT
HELD THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE SENATE. THE
DLP USED ITS MUSCLE (ALSO EXERTED THROUGH THE
COALITION'S DEPENDENCE ON PREFERENCES TO WIN
MANY SEATS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) TO
INFLUENCE GOVERNMENT POLICIES ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS,
DEFENCE AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. THE AUSTRALIAN
DEMOCRATS ARE LESS LIKELY TO PRESS FOR PARTICULAR
POLICIES, OR ARE LIKELY TO HAVE LESS CLOUT IF THEY
DO. THEY ARE ALSO INHIBITED BY THEIR OWN
PRINCIPLES FROM MAKING COVERT DEALS WITH EITHER
OF THE MAJOR PARTIES.
THE DEMOCRATS' INFLUENCE WILL BE FELT IN
OTHER WAYS. THEY ARE LIKELY TO THROW THEIR
WEIGHT BEHIND MOVES BY LEADING LABOR AND
INDEPENDENT-MINDED LIBERAL SENATORS TO MAKE THE
SENATE A MORE EFFECTIVE HOUSE OF REVIEW BY
STRENGTHENING THE COMMITTEE SYSTEM AND
SUBJECTING LEGISLATION TO CLOSER SCRUTINY. THE
KNOWLEDGE THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE
A MAJORITY AND THAT THEREFORE THEY CANNOT BE
HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFEAT OF ANY LEGISLATION
IS ALSO LIKELY TO MAKE DISSIDENT LIBERAL SENATORS
MORE ASSERTIVE AND CRITICAL. AS THE DEMOCRATS
ARE PLEDGED NOT TO BLOCK SUPPLY TO FORCE A
GOVERNMENT PREMATURELY TO THE POLLS, THE
COALITION IS SAFE FROM A CRISIS OF THE KIND ITS
MEMBERS CREATED TO TOPPLE THE WHITLAM
GOVERNMENT. AND SO LONG AS THE DEMOCRATS DO
NOT BECOME OBSTRUCTIVE AND DISRUPTIVE IN OTHER
WAYS, A SENATE THAT NO LONGER ACTS MAINLY AS A
RUBBER STAMP FOR GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION COULD
BE TO THE NATIONAL GOOD. IF THE SENATE DOES
REJECT LEGISLATION CONTRARY TO MAJORITY PUBLIC
OPINION, THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS A POWERFUL
WEAPON IN ITS ABILITY TO CALL FOR A DOUBLE
DISSOLUTION, WHICH SWEPT THE DLP OUT OF THE
SENATE. THE DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO AWARE THAT THEIR
OWN SURVIVAL MAY WELL DEPEND ON THEIR
PERFORMANCE. THEY WOULD BE FOOLISH TO MISUSE
THEIR POWER.
<F45>
FRIDAY 14 NOVEMBER 1980
"POWER: BLACKER AND BLACKER"
WITH EACH DAY NEW EVIDENCE IS COMING TO
LIGHT ABOUT THE CRISIS LOOMING OVER
VICTORIA'S ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES. A FORTNIGHT AGO
IN THESE COLUMNS WE POINTED OUT THAT THE LONG
DELAYS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF MAJOR POWER
STATIONS AT NEWPORT, YALLOURN W AND LOY YANG
- DELAYS MOSTLY CAUSED BY INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES
- WOULD MAKE OUR ELECTRICITY SIGNIFICANTLY MORE
EXPENSIVE IN THE 1980S AND COULD EVEN LEAD TO
BLACKOUTS AS SUPPLY FAILS TO KEEP PACE WITH THE
GROWING DEMAND. NOW NEW LEAKED DOCUMENTS
FROM THE SEC HAVE INDICATED THAT NEWPORT MAY
HAVE TO BURN FUEL OIL FAR MORE OFTEN THAN THE
96 DAYS A YEAR PERMITTED BY ITS LICENCE FROM THE
EPA - OR BE SHUT DOWN, WITH THE RISK OF
CAUSING POWER BLACKOUTS. THEN IN STATE
PARLIAMENT ON WEDNESDAY THE ALP MADE A
SERIES OF EXTRAORDINARY ALLEGATIONS OF
MISMANAGEMENT BY THE SEC, CLAIMING THAT
VICTORIA FACED CERTAIN LARGE-SCALE BLACKOUTS
FROM 1983 - AND CALLING FOR A ROYAL COMMIS-
SION INTO THE SEC.
THE ALLEGATIONS MADE BY LABOR'S ENERGY
SPOKESMAN, MR AMOS, WERE SOME OF THE MOST
SERIOUS EVER MADE BY AN OPPOSITION AGAINST
SUCH AN IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY. MR
AMOS CLAIMED THAT THE SEC HAD CONTINUALLY
LIED TO PARLIAMENT AND TO MINISTERS, THAT ITS
"MANAGERIAL INCOMPETENCE" HAD GUARANTEED THAT
VICTORIA WOULD FACE FOUR YEARS OF ELECTRICITY
SHORTAGES, THAT IT HAD RUN ITSELF INTO VIRTUAL
INSOLVENCY THROUGH FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT,
AND THAT IT HAD DELIBERATELY CONSPIRED TO PROVOKE
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES IN THE LATROBE VALLEY. HE
ARGUED THAT THE LOY YANG POWER STATION WOULD
NOT START PRODUCING ELECTRICITY UNTIL MAY 1986
- THREE YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE - AND THAT FROM
1983 TO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE VICTORIA FACED
HUGE ELECTRICITY SHORTFALLS. ON HIS FIGURES, FOR
INSTANCE, IN 1986-87 THE DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY
WOULD EXCEED THE SUPPLY BY AN AMOUNT EQUAL
TO THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION OF
VICTORIA'S FOUR MILLION PEOPLE!
THESE ARE EXTREMELY GRAVE CHARGES. SOME
OF THEM, PARTICULARLY THOSE CONCERNING FUTURE
POWER SHORTFALLS, APPEAR TO BE WELL-FOUNDED AND
OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO VICTORIA. IT IS UNFORTUNATE
THAT THEY WERE OVERSHADOWED BY OTHERS WHICH
APPEAR EXAGGERATIONS AND BASELESS VITUPERATION
STEMMING FROM THE LONG VENDETTA BETWEEN MR
AMOS AND THE AUTHORITY FOR WHICH HE HOPES TO
BECOME RESPONSIBLE AS MINISTER. TO TAKE ONE
EXAMPLE: IT IS FAIR COMMENT TO SAY THAT THE
SEC HELPED TO PROVOKE SOME OF THE LOY YANG
DISPUTES BY FOOLISH INDUSTRIAL BRINKMANSHIP. BUT
TO CLAIM, AS MR AMOS DOES, THAT THE SEC
DELIBERATELY CONSPIRED TO CLOSE DOWN WORK AT
LOY YANG TO DIVERT PARLIAMENT'S ATTENTION FROM
ITS OWN MISMANAGEMENT SUGGESTS THAT LABOR
NEEDS A NEW ENERGY SPOKESMAN WHOSE JUDGMENT
HAS NOT BEEN STRAINED BY ANIMOSITY.
THE ANALYSIS OF VICTORIA'S FUTURE ELECTRICITY
SUPPLY PRESENTED BY MR AMOS, HOWEVER, IS
ANOTHER MATTER. HE QUOTED AN UNNAMED "EXPERT"
AS POINTING OUT TWO SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE SEC'S
FORECAST OF THE FUTURE DEMAND AND SUPPLY OF
ELECTRICITY - A FORECAST WHICH ITSELF PREDICTED
SUPPLY SHORTFALLS OF UP TO 600 MILLION KILOWATT
HOURS A YEAR BETWEEN 1983 AND 1987. THE
ANONYMOUS EXPERT ARGUED PERSUASIVELY THAT THE
SHORTFALLS WILL MOST LIKELY BE FAR GREATER THAN
THE SEC PREDICTS, CAUSING LARGE-SCALE BLACKOUTS
IN VICTORIAN FACTORIES, HOMES, SHOPS AND OFFICES
FOR SOME YEARS. HE POINTED OUT THAT THE SEC
FORECAST ASSUMED THAT THE LOY YANG GENERATORS
WOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE FROM THE START AT CLOSE
TO CAPACITY, WHEREAS PAST EXPERIENCE
SUGGESTED THAT TEETHING TROUBLES WOULD REDUCE
THEIR INITIAL USEFULNESS TO ABOUT 60 PER CENT
CAPACITY. FURTHERMORE, THE SEC FORECAST ASSUMED
THAT LOY YANG WOULD PROCEED TO COMPLETION
WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DELAYS DUE TO INDUSTRIAL
DISPUTES. THIS OPTIMISM ALSO SEEMS QUITE
UNWARRANTED ON PAST EXPERIENCE.
THE ANALYSIS PRESENTED BY MR AMOS SUGGESTS
THAT ELECTRICITY BLACKOUTS ARE LIKELY TO BECOME
PART OF THE WAY OF LIFE OF VICTORIANS IN THE 1980S,
PARTICULARLY IF ALCOA'S PORTLAND SMELTER IS BUILT
AS PLANNED. ONE CAN TAKE NO REASSURANCE FROM
THE BLAND DENIAL OF THIS GIVEN IN PARLIAMENT
YESTERDAY BY THE MINISTER FOR MINERALS AND
ENERGY, MR BALFOUR. THE MINISTER WAS ON MORE
SOLID GROUND WHEN HE ARGUED THAT THE SUPPLY
PROBLEMS, WHICH HE CLAIMED WERE NO MORE THAN
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS IN 1984 AND 1985, STEMMED
FROM THE LONG UNION BAN ON THE NEWPORT POWER
STATION AND THE CONTINUAL INDUSTRIAL UNREST AT
YALLOURN W AND LOY YANG. INDEED THEY DO.
AND ANY ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM FACING VICTORIA
WHICH TRIES TO SHIFT THE WHOLE BLAME ON TO THE
SEC WILL INEVITABLY PROVE BARREN WHEN IT COMES
TO FINDING SOLUTIONS.
VICTORIA DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEED A ROYAL
COMMISSION INTO THE SEC. IT DOES NEED SOME
RUTHLESS SOUL-SEARCHING BY THE TRADE UNION
MOVEMENT AND ITS POLITICAL ALLIES, BY THE SEC
AND ITS CONTRACTORS, AND BY THE HAMER
GOVERNMENT ABOUT HOW THIS CRISIS DEVELOPED,
HOW THEIR OWN ACTIONS (OR INACTION) CONTRIBUTED
TO IT, AND HOW IT CAN BE HEADED OFF. A LOT OF
COMPROMISES MUST BE MADE NOW TO ENABLE THE
POWER STATIONS TO BE BUILT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
ELECTRICITY IS TOO IMPORTANT TO EVERYONE FOR US
TO BE ABLE TO TOLERATE CAVALIER STRIKES, LOCKOUTS
AND DEMARCATION DISPUTES ANY MORE. SOME FORM
OF INDUSTRIAL CONTRACT IS NEEDED WHICH WILL
GUARANTEE GOOD WAGES, A SPEEDY AND FAIR
PROCEDURE FOR SETTLING DISPUTES AND BAN STRIKES
AND LOCKOUTS. THE TRADES HALL COUNCIL SHOULD
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SETTLING THE PLAGUE OF
DEMARCATION DISPUTES WHICH HAVE UPSET WORK
ON THE POWER STATIONS. THE HAMER GOVERNMENT
SHOULD PERSUADE ALCOA TO POSTPONE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE PORTLAND SMELTER UNTIL ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES
ARE ASSURED. WORKERS NEED ELECTRICITY FOR THEIR
JOBS; FAMILIES NEED ELECTRICITY FOR THEIR HOME
LIFE. UNLESS WE HAVE POLITICIANS AND UNION LEADERS
WHO UNDERSTAND THIS, VICTORIA IS HEADED FOR
SERIOUS TROUBLE.

SATURDAY 15 NOVEMBER 1980
"'THE AGE' AND THE DOCUMENTS"
'THE AGE' THIS WEEK HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN
A HIGH COURT CASE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE
TO THE WORKING OF AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY. WE ARE
REFRAINING FROM COMMENT UNTIL MR JUSTICE MASON
HAS HANDED DOWN HIS JUDGMENT. THIS WILL BE IN
ABOUT TWO WEEKS' TIME. WHEN HE HAS DECIDED
WHETHER TO REIMPOSE OR TO LIFT THE INJUCTION
AGAINST THE PUBLICATION OF EXTRACTS FROM THE
BOOK 'DOCUMENTS ON AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE AND
FOREIGN POLICY 1968-75', WE SHALL HAVE PLENTY
TO SAY, PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE AUSTRALIAN
GOVERNMENT, ITS BUREAUCRATS, OFFICIAL SECRECY,
AND THE PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW.
"THE VOYAGE TO SATURN"
THERE ARE NOT TOO MANY TRIPS WHERE YOU
COULD GET AWAY WITH BEING 1500 KILOMETRES
OFF COURSE. BUT THE VOYAGER I'S TRIP FROM EARTH
TO THE RINGS OF THE PLANET SATURN HAS BEEN NO
ORDINARY TRIP. FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS THIS
LITTLE UNMANNED SPACESHIP, NO BIGGER THAN A
VOLKSWAGEN, HAS BEEN HURTLING THROUGH SPACE
AT 65,000 KILOMETRES AN HOUR TOWARDS THE OUTER
REACHES OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. WHEN IT LEFT FLORIDA
ON 5 SEPTEMBER 1977 TO BEGIN THE 2000-MILLION-
KILOMETRE TRIP TO SATURN, ITS CONTROLLERS ESTIMATED
THAT VOYAGER I WOULD REACH ITS DESTINATION AT 1
AM GREENWICH MEAN TIME ON 13 NOVEMBER 1980.
IT ARRIVED ON THURSDAY, RIGHT ON TIME.
ACROSS THIS IMMENSE DISTANCE, VOYAGER I HAS
SENT BACK COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS AND SCIENTIFIC
MEASUREMENTS FASCINATING TO ASTRONOMERS AND
LAYMEN ALIKE. WHEN PASSING JUPITER LAST YEAR,
VOYAGER PHOTOGRAPHED A SPECTACULAR POLAR
AURORA FAR LARGER THAN EARTH'S, BOLTS OF DAZZLING
LIGHTNING, HUGE ACTIVE VOLCANOES ON THE MOON
IO, AND A RING OF ROCKS PERPETUALLY CIRCLING THE
GIANT PLANET. ITS DISCOVERIES ON SATURN HAVE BEEN
NO LESS ENTHRALLING. IT PHOTOGRAPHED THREE MOONS
PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN TO MAN, AND A HUGE CLOUD OF
GLOWING GAS CIRCLING THE MULTI-COLORED PLANET. IT
FOUND TWO OTHER MOONS SHARING AN IDENTICAL ORBIT,
SWAPPING THE LEAD WITH EACH OTHER IN AN ETERNAL
TAG RACE AROUND THE PLANET. AND THE FAMOUS
RINGS THEMSELVES, WHICH SEEMED FROM OUR
DISTANCE TO FORM FOUR BROAD BANDS GROOVED AS
EVENLY AS A GRAMOPHONE DISC, VOYAGER HAS SHOWN
TO BE BILLIONS OF ROCKS AND ICE PARTICLES WHIZZING
AROUND IN HUNDREDS OF RINGS AND RINGLETS, SOME
JAGGED, SOME SMOOTH, SOME EVEN BRAIDED ACROSS
EACH OTHER'S ORBIT IN DEFIANCE OF WHAT MAN HAD
ASSUMED TO BE THE LAWS OF PHYSICS.
THE DISCOVERIES OF VOYAGER I WILL MAKE NO
DIFFERENCE TO OUR LIFE ON EARTH. EVEN THE MOST
EXCITING PROSPECT ITS TRIP HELD OUT, THE POSSIBILITY
THAT THE MOON TITAN MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF
SUSTAINING LIFE, HAS BEEN DAMPENED BY ITS FINDING
THAT TITAN HAS FEWER HYDROCARBONS THAN EXPECTED,
AND TEMPERATURES OF FROM MINUS 100 TO MINUS
200 DEGREES. WHAT IT HAS DONE HAS BEEN TO FEED
MAN'S CURIOSITY ABOUT THE WORLD IN WHICH WE
FIND OURSELVES, A TINY PLANET OF LIFE IN A VAST
UNIVERSE OF INANIMATE ROCKS, VAPORS, GASES AND
SPACE. VOYAGER I HAS TOLD US THINGS WE DID NOT
KNOW, OPENED UP NEW PUZZLES FOR ASTRONOMERS
AND PERHAPS GIVEN NEW CLUES IN THE ENDLESS
SEARCH TO DISCOVER THE ORIGIN OF LIFE. NOW ITS
WORK IS ALMOST DONE, IT WILL HEAD OFF TOWARDS
OUTER SPACE, MAYBE TO LAND MILLIONS OF YEARS
HENCE ON ANOTHER PLANET, WHERE ITS TIME CAPSULE
OF PHOTOGRAPHS, HUMAN SOUNDS AND MUSIC  MAY
BE OPENED TO REVEAL TO OTHER LIFE FORMS
SOMETHING OF LIFE ON PLANET EARTH IN THE 1970S.
THE STORY OF VOYAGER I IS A STORY OF SCIENTIFIC
EXCELLENCE, AN INSPIRING TESTAMENT OF WHAT MAN
CAN ACHIEVE. WHEN WE CANNOT GET EVEN OUR LOCAL
TRAINS TO RUN ON TIME, THE IDEA OF A TRIP OF 2000
MILLION KILOMETRES BEING ACCOMPLISHED DEAD ON
TIME IS STAGGERING. IT IS OF COURSE FAIR TO QUESTION
THE PRIORITY GIVEN TO SPACE RESEARCH. READERS OF
OUR FRONT PAGE YESTERDAY MAY HAVE ASKED THEM-
SELVES WHY A CIVILISATION CAPABLE OF SUCH A FEAT
CANNOT FEED THE 12 MILLION PEOPLE NOW FACING
STARVATION IN EASTERN AFRICA AS A RESULT OF
DROUGHT AND WAR. THE REASON IS NOT SIMPLY ONE
OF FUNDS. THE ENTIRE VOYAGER PROJECT, INCLUDING
ITS TWIN VOYAGER II NOW ON ITS WAY TO SATURN,
URANUS AND NEPTUNE, HAS COST NO MORE THAN THE
MELBOURNE UNDERGROUND RAIL LOOP. THE VOYAGER
PROJECT HAS BEEN A TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN WILL TO
ACHIEVE THROUGH DISCIPLINE AND APPLICATION WHAT
HAD SEEMED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE. IF ONLY WE COULD
APPLY THE SAME DEDICATION TO SOLVING THE
PROBLEMS OF MAN.
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
MELBOURNE USED TO BE THE MECCA OF BOOK
LOVERS, AND SECONDHAND BOOKSHOPS
FLOURISHED IN THE CITY. TRADITIONALLY, THE SHOPS
WERE IN BOURKE STREET - NOTED FOR ITS
BOOKSELLERS AS FAR BACK AS THE 1850S - BEFORE
COLE'S BOOK ARCADE, WITH ITS SECONDHAND
DEPARTMENT, BECAME A LANDMARK.
BIBLIOPHILES WITH LONG MEMORIES RECALL
WHEN THE STREET STILL RETAINED THAT EMINENCE.
SEARCHING FOR A RARE TITLE, THEY COULD START AT
THE TOP OF THE STREET, AT ELLIS BIRD'S TIGHTLY
STOCKED PREMISES, AND PROGRESS DOWN TO
SPENCER'S HILL OF CONTENT, ON TO COULTER'S
CAVERNOUS SHOP NEAR THE POST OFFICE, AND ACROSS
TO HALL'S SPACIOUS STORE, BEFORE HEADING FOR
EVANS'S IN COLLINS STREET.
TODAY THE SCENE HAS CHANGED. ONE BY ONE
THE CITY'S OLDER SECONDHAND BOOK STORES HAVE
FOLDED OR TRANSFERRED TO THE SUBURBS -
NOTABLY, PRAHRAN. MOST OF THOSE STILL REMAINING
IN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT OPERATE LESS
CONSPICUOUSLY UPSTAIRS, OR IN THE LITTLE STREETS.
A FEW GENERAL BOOKSHOPS OFFER A SMALL RANGE
OF USED VOLUMES ALONG WITH THEIR NEW ONES.
A SECONDHAND BOOKSHOP IS NOT, OF COURSE,
THE KIND OF BUSINESS EVERYBODY COULD RUN.
SOME OTHER KINDS OF SHOPS COULD BE
SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCTED BY ANYONE WITH A NORMAL
AMOUNT OF BUSINESS SENSE; OTHERS CALL FOR A
SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRADE BUT DO NOT
REQUIRE MUCH EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT. A
BUTCHER, FOR EXAMPLE, MIGHT PROSPER WITHOUT
FEELING ANY PERSONAL ATTACHMENT TO PARTICULAR
CUTS OF STEAK HE SELLS; SO MIGHT A HARDWARE
MERCHANT, WITHOUT BEING SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THE
NAILS OR NUTS HE STOCKS.
THE DEALER IN SECONDHAND BOOKS, HOWEVER,
IN ADDITION TO POSSESSING BUSINESS ACUMEN, AND
KNOWING THE INS AND OUTS OF THE TRADE, ALSO
MUST BE A BOOK LOVER. IF HE CAME UPON A FIRST
EDITION OF A SAMUEL JOHNSON, A KILMARNOCK
BURNS OR, LESS LIKELY, A FOLIO SHAKESPEARE, HE
WOULD HANDLE IT WITH REVERENCE. TO HIM IT IS
NOT SIMPLY AN ARTICLE OF COMMERCE BUT A RARE
TREASURE FROM THE PAST. HE MIGHT EVEN FEEL A
PANG WHEN PARTING WITH IT TO THE FORTUNATE
BUYER, AT WHATEVER PRICE.
HE ALSO MUST BE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH
THE WIDER WORLD OF OLD BOOKS: WITH THOSE ON
JOUSTING OR BLOODLETTING, AS WITH OTHERS ON
VELOCIPEDES, AND CHIMNEYSWEEPS. HE MUST BE A
WALKING DATABANK, ANSWERING CLIENTS' QUESTIONS
ON WHO WROTE ABOUT "CARES THAT INFEST THE DAY
FOLDING THEIR TENTS LIKE THE ARABS"? AND WHERE,
IN SHAKESPEARE, IS "THE STARS ABOVE US GOVERN
OUR CONDITIONS"?
MOREOVER, THE SELLER OF SECONDHAND VOLUMES
MUST POSSESS AN ANTIQUARIAN'S INTEREST  IN HIS
CALLING. HE IS EXPECTED TO BE AS FAMILIAR WITH
THE WORKS OF AUTHORS LONG DEAD AS HE IS WITH
WRITERS OF TODAY. HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISCUSS
EDITIONS OF VOLNAY'S 'RUINS OF EMPIRE', STURM'S
'REFLECTIONS', AND HERVEY'S 'MEDITATIONS AMONG
THE TOMBS', AS KNOWLEDGEABLY AS CURRENT TITLES
SUCH AS SEGFORD'S 'FREQUENCY SYNTHESISATION',
ORWELL'S 'NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR', OR 'TODAY'S
ENGLISH VERSION' OF THE BIBLE.
HIS SHOP IS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THIS AGE AND
THE HISTORIC PAST, SINCE AUTHORS THROUGH THE
CENTURIES HAVE RECORDED LIFE AS IT WAS IN THEIR
OWN TIMES. IN PRESERVING FROM EXTINCTION AND
PASSING ON WHAT REMAINS OF OUT-OF-PRINT
LITERATURE, THE SECONDHAND BOOKSELLER RENDERS AN
INESTIMABLE SERVICE TO READERS TODAY.

MONDAY 17 NOVEMBER 1980
"SHREWD BID FOR POLL REFORM"
POLITICAL PARTIES TEND TO FAVOR THE ELECTORAL
SYSTEM WHICH GIVES THEM THE BEST CHANCE OF
GAINING OR RETAINING POWER, WHILE CONDEMNING
THOSE THEY SEE AS PLACING THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE.
BUT THE CALL FOR ELECTORAL REFORM BY THE FEDERAL
OPPOSITION LEADER, MR HAYDEN, AT THE ALP
VICTORIAN CONFERENCE YESTERDAY SHOULD NOT BE
REGARDED SIMPLY AS A LOSER'S PROTEST. HE HAS A
VALID POINT IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE PROPORTION OF VOTES AND
THE NUMBER OF SEATS THE VARIOUS PARTIES WON IN
THE RECENT FEDERAL ELECTION. LABOR WON NEARLY
50 PER CENT OF THE POPULAR VOTE FOR THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES BUT ONLY ABOUT 40 PER CENT OF
THE SEATS. MR HAYDEN CONCEDED THAT LABOR COULD
NOT HAVE WON UNDER ANY SYSTEM OF MAJORITY RULE
BECAUSE IT SIMPLY FAILED TO WIN ENOUGH VOTES. BUT
IN THREE POST-WAR FEDERAL ELECTIONS - 1954, 1961
AND 1969 - THE LIBERAL-COUNTRY PARTY COALITION
BECAME THE GOVERNMENT WITH A MINORITY OF VOTES
EVEN AFTER THE ALLOCATION OF PREFERENCES.
MR HAYDEN PROPOSES THAT THE LABOR PARTY
SHOULD CAREFULLY EXAMINE ALTERNATIVES TO THE
PRESENT SYSTEM OF PREFERENTIAL VOTING IN SINGLE-
MEMBER ELECTORATES FOR THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES, AND SEEK THE SUPPORT OF THE
AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE FOR SUITABLE
REFORM. LABOR'S PRESENT POLICY IS FOR THE
ACCEPTANCE OF OPTIONAL PREFERENTIAL VOTING. THIS
WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT MAINLY OF SIMPLIFYING THE
VOTERS' TASK AND REDUCING THE HIGH PROPORTION OF
INFORMAL VOTES IN BALLOTS FOR THE SENATE, AND
WOULD NOT REALLY ALTER THE SYSTEM FOR THE HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES. FORMERLY, MANY LABOR PARTY
MEMBERS FAVORED A RETURN TO THE FIRST-PAST-THE-
POST SYSTEM, MAINLY AS A MEANS OF ELIMINATING
THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC LABOR PARTY AND
BLOCKING THE EXCHANGE OF PREFERENCES BETWEEN
THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTIES. BUT
THIS SYSTEM WOULD NO LONGER BENEFIT LABOR. IN
THE RECENT ELECTION, LABOR WON THREE SEATS -
BALLARAT, MCMILLAN AND KALGOORLIE - ON
PREFERENCES THAT THE LIBERALS WOULD HAVE WON IN
A FIRST-PAST-THE-POST POLL, AND LOST ONLY ONE,
BARTON, WHICH THE LIBERAL CANDIDATE WON ON
INDEPENDENT PREFERENCES. THE MAIN OBJECTION TO
FIRST-PAST-THE-POST VOTING IS THAT IT IS THE LEAST
REPRESENTATIVE OF VOTERS' WISHES. AND, OF COURSE,
THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS WOULD REJECT IT.
THE SYSTEM MR HAYDEN PERSONALLY FAVORS IS
ALSO THE ONE THE DEMOCRATS WOULD LIKE TO SEE
ADOPTED - THAT OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION
BASED ON MULTI-MEMBER ELECTORATES. THERE IS NO
DOUBT THAT, WHATEVER THE EFFECT SUCH A CHANGE
WOULD HAVE ON THE VARIOUS PARTIES, IT WOULD
PROVIDE THE FAIREST AND MOST ACCURATE REFLECTION
IN PARLIAMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S WISHES. IT WOULD
NOT IN ITSELF PRODUCE A PRO-LABOR BIAS, BUT SIMPLY
MINIMISE LABOR'S PRESENT HANDICAP IN THE
DISTRIBUTION OF ITS SUPPORT. MUCH OF LABOR'S VOTE
IS WASTED IN SAFE ELECTORATES WHERE ITS CANDIDATES
WIN BY LARGE MARGINS, WHEREAS THE LIBERALS WIN
MANY SEATS WITH VERY NARROW MARGINS. ANOTHER
ADVANTAGE FOR VOTERS OF MULTI-MEMBER ELECTORATES
IS THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE
THE OUTCOME OF ELECTIONS AND THAT MOST PEOPLE
WOULD BE REPRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT BY MEMBERS
FOR WHOM THEY ACTUALLY VOTED. AT PRESENT,
ELECTIONS ARE DECIDED BY SWINGING VOTERS IN ONLY
A RELATIVELY FEW MARGINAL SEATS, AND MANY VOTERS
ARE VIRTUALLY DISENFRANCHISED IN SEATS WHICH
HARDLY EVER CHANGE HANDS. THE DRAWBACK OF
MULTI-MEMBER ELECTORATES IS THAT THEY WOULD
HAVE TO BE VERY MUCH LARGER IN AREA (AND
POSSIBLY CUT ACROSS STATE BOUNDARIES), WHILE
PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION COULD LEAD TO FEWER
CLEAR-CUT RESULTS, LEAVING A MINORITY PARTY SUCH
AS THE DEMOCRATS WITH A BALANCE OF POWER.
HOWEVER, THE TASMANIAN EXPERIENCE DOES NOT
SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT THAT PR ENCOURAGES A
PROLIFERATION OF SPLINTER PARTIES.
THE LEAST CONTROVERSIAL OF MR HAYDEN'S
SUGGESTIONS IS THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE "DONKEY
VOTE" BE ELIMINATED. AS SOME VOTERS, THROUGH
IGNORANCE OR INDIFFERENCE, VOTE STRAIGHT DOWN THE
BALLOT PAPER, THE CANDIDATE AT THE TOP OF THE
BALLOT HAS A MARGINAL ADVANTAGE. MR HAYDEN
SUGGESTS THAT EITHER THE POSITION ON A VOTING
PAPER SHOULD BE DECIDED BY BALLOT OR THAT
DIFFERENT BATCHES OF BALLOT PAPERS SHOULD LIST THE
CANDIDATES IN A DIFFERENT ORDER, SO AS TO ELIMINATE
THE ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE OF ALPHABETICAL
LISTING. THIS IS A CHANGE ALL PARTIES SHOULD BE
ABLE TO AGREE ON. MR HAYDEN'S OTHER PRINCIPAL
PROPOSAL IS FOR PUBLIC FUNDING OF ELECTION
CAMPAIGNS AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF POLITICAL
DONATIONS - MEASURES WHICH 'THE AGE' HAS
CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED.
MR HAYDEN'S PROPOSED FLIRTATION WITH THE
AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS ON ELECTORAL REFORM IS
SHREWDLY AIMED. THE DEMOCRATS' SURVIVAL AS AN
INFLUENTIAL THIRD FORCE IN POLITICS COULD WELL
DEPEND ON A CHANGE IN THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM. THE
LABOR LEADER REALISES, OF COURSE, THAT A LABOR-
DEMOCRAT AXIS IN THE SENATE HAS NO PROSPECT OF
IMPOSING ELECTORAL CHANGES ON A HOSTILE
GOVERNMENT. BUT THERE IS VALUE IN BRINGING THE
SUBJECT INTO PUBLIC DEBATE AND IN INTERESTING
VOTERS IN REFORMS THAT WOULD BE TO THEIR
ADVANTAGE RATHER THAN TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER.
AND, NOT LEAST, MR HAYDEN IS AWARE THAT IF LABOR
WINS OFFICE IN THREE YEARS AND THE DEMOCRATS
RETAIN THE BALANCE IN THE SENATE, ELECTORAL REFORM
COULD BECOME A REALITY.
"SANE APPROACH TO SEX LAWS"
COMMON SENSE HAS PREVAILED OVER PREJUDICE
AND APPREHENSION IN THE STATE PARLIAMENTARY
LIBERAL PARTY OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSED
REFORMS OF THE LAW COVERING SEXUAL OFFENCES.
DESPITE THE MISGIVINGS OF SOME MEMBERS, THE
WAY IS CLEAR FOR PARLIAMENT TO ADOPT LEGISLATION
THAT IS FOR THE MOST PART JUST, RATIONAL AND
HUMANE. THE MAIN PROVISIONS, BY TAKING THE
GENDER OUT OF SEX OFFENCES, WILL IN EFFECT SWEEP
AWAY THE ARCHAIC LEGAL PROHIBITIONS ON MALE
HOMOSEXUAL PRACTICES. IN SO DOING, THE LAW WILL
FOLLOW RATHER THAN LEAD PREDOMINANT PUBLIC
OPINION. THE CRIMINAL LAW IS TO BE LARGELY
CONFINED TO ITS PROPER SCOPE OF PROTECTING
INDIVIDUALS AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT AND COERCION,
AND PROTECTING THOSE DEEMED TOO YOUNG OR
OTHERWISE INCAPABLE OF CONSENTING TO SEXUAL
SEDUCTION. SEXUAL ACTS BETWEEN PERSONS OF THE
SAME SEX WILL BE TREATED BY THE LAW IN THE SAME
WAY AS SEXUAL ACTS BETWEEN PERSONS OF DIFFERENT
SEXES. THIS NON-DISCRIMINATORY APPROACH WILL
ALSO APPLY TO PROSTITUTION AND RELATED OFFENCES,
WHICH WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF FURTHER LEGISLATIVE
REVIEW.
THE ORIGINAL DRAFT LEGISLATION ALSO PROPOSED
TO REDUCE THE AGE OF CONSENT TO 16, BUT THIS HAS
BEEN MODIFIED IN RESPONSE TO PRESSURES WITHIN
THE PARTY ROOM. IT IS TO BE AN OFFENCE FOR ANYONE
FIVE YEARS OLDER TO HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH
SOMEONE AGED 16 TO 18. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE
LEGISLATION DOES RECOGNISE THAT MANY YOUNG
PEOPLE ENGAGE IN SEX AT AN EARLY AGE. A BOY OR
GIRL UNDER 16 MAY BE ALLOWED TO CONSENT TO SEX
WITH A PARTNER UP TO TWO YEARS OLDER. HOWEVER,
THE LAW WILL STRENGTHEN PROTECTION OF PEOPLE,
SUCH AS MENTAL PATIENTS AND YOUNG STUDENTS OR
EMPLOYEES, WHO ARE UNDER SOMEONE'S AUTHORITY.
SIMILARLY, A NEW OFFENCE WILL BE CREATED TO
PENALISE ANYONE WHO HAS THE CARE OF OR
RESPONSIBILITY FOR A PERSON UNDER 18 AND ACTIVELY
ENCOURAGES OR INDUCES HIM OR HER TO ENGAGE IN
SEXUAL ACTS. THE INTENTION IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT,
IF INTERPRETED TOO BROADLY, THIS PROVISION COULD
LEAD TO ABSURD CONSEQUENCES AND SEEMS
UNNECESSARY. RETENTION OF ANCIENT LEGAL TABOOS
AGAINST INCEST ALSO SEEMS UNNECESSARY, SINCE
OTHER PROVISIONS ALREADY FORBID INTERCOURSE WITH
PERSONS BELOW THE AGE OF CONSENT AND PRESCRIBE
HEAVIER PENALTIES FOR SEXUAL ABUSE BY ANYONE IN
A POSITION OF AUTHORITY.
THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION MAKES SOME USEFUL
CHANGES IN THE LAW RELATING TO RAPE. THE
POSSIBILITY OF RAPE WITHIN MARRIAGE WILL BE
RECOGNISED WHERE THE PARTNERS HAVE SEPARATED;
CONVICTIONS FOR RAPE WILL BE MADE EASIER WHERE
THE VICTIM'S UNCORROBORATED EVIDENCE IS ACCEPTED
BY THE COURT; AND A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF 20
YEARS' JAIL IS PROVIDED FOR RAPE WITH DEFINED
"AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES". HAVING AGREED TO
SUCH SWEEPING REFORM OF THE LAW RELATING TO
HOMOSEXUALITY, THE GOVERNING PARTY SHOULD TURN
ITS ATTENTION NOW TO BRINGING COMMERCIAL SEX
WITHIN A RATIONAL - AND ENFORCEABLE - CODE.
HERE THE LAW SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH PUBLIC
ORDER, HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL AMENITY, AND
NOT INTERFERE WITH THE ACTIVITIES OF CONSENTING
ADULTS - PROVIDED THERE IS NO THIRD PARTY
COERCION - SIMPLY BECAUSE AN EXCHANGE OF
MONEY IS INVOLVED.

WEDNESDAY 19 NOVEMBER 1980
"THE TIMOR TRAGEDY"
TWO DISTURBING POINTS EMERGE FROM THE US
STATE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS ON EAST
TIMOR, PUBLISHED BY 'THE AGE' TODAY. FIRST, IT IS
CLEAR THAT THE INDONESIANS ARE PRESSING AHEAD
WITH REMAKING THE COUNTRY TO SUIT THEMSELVES.
SECOND, AUSTRALIA'S AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA,
MR CRITCHLEY, WHOSE ASSESSMENT OF EAST TIMOR
IS QUOTED IN THE DOCUMENTS, APPEARS TO ACCEPT
TOO EASILY INDONESIA'S ATTITUDES AND ACTIONS -
AS DOES THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MR
STREET. MR CRITCHLEY'S REMARKS, AS QUOTED BY
THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN JAKARTA, INDICATE
THAT THE BISHOP OF DILI "REFUSES TO ACCEPT THAT
THERE IS NO CHANCE OF THE INDONESIANS AGREEING
TO HOLD AN INTERNATIONALLY OBSERVED PLEBISCITE"
AND THAT "THIS COLORS HIS APPROACH TO ALL ISSUES".
MR CRITCHLEY BELIEVES IT WOULD BE "A
MISTAKE TO MAKE TOO MUCH OF" THE FACT THAT
"MANY OF THE ELITE, PARTICULARLY FORMER FRETILIN
AND PRO-PORTUGUESE ELEMENTS, WOULD SHARE THE
BISHOP'S RELUCTANCE TO ACCEPT INDONESIAN
CONTROL". HE IS STRUCK BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH
THE INDONESIAN LANGUAGE HAS BEEN ACCEPTED, "NOT
LEAST BY THE CHILDREN WHO SING PATRIOTIC
INDONESIAN SONGS WITH ENTHUSIASM". HE BELIEVES
ALSO THAT "THE BULK OF THE POPULATION WILL CLEARLY
ACCEPT WHATEVER AUTHORITY EXISTS AT THE TIME".
IT IS A PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO A QUESTION OF
PRINCIPLE, AND LEADS BACK TO THE FIRST POINT.
JUST A FORTNIGHT AGO, THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL
ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON DECOLONISATION
REAFFIRMED THE RIGHT OF THE EAST TIMORESE TO
SELF-DETERMINATION AND INDEPENDENCE. WHATEVER
ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN ADVANCED OVER THE PAST
FIVE YEARS TO JUSTIFY THE INDONESIAN INVASION,
THE FACT IS THAT IS WAS AN INTERVENTION BY FORCE
AGAINST A NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT.
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF CIVIL WAR AND FAMINE, THE
MOVEMENT IS NEARLY DESTROYED.
EAST TIMOR AND ITS SHATTERED PEOPLE HAVE
TO BE REBUILT. HOWEVER, AS THE DOCUMENTS POINT
UP, RECONSTRUCTION IS BEING HANDLED WITH
INDONESIAN, MORE THAN TIMORESE, INTERESTS IN
MIND. THE COST IS SOCIAL DISRUPTION ON A BROAD
SCALE, AS TRADITIONAL WAYS ARE SUBORDINATED TO
THE INDONESIAN DRIVE FOR INTEGRATION. AN
INTENSIVE TRIBAL RELOCATION PROGRAMME IS PART OF
A DETERMINED INDONESIAN DEVELOPMENT OF CENTRES
OF POPULATION FOR A CONQUERED PEOPLE, MANY OF
WHOM ARE MIGRATORY BY TRADITION. OF COURSE,
THIS IS CONVENIENT FOR THE AUTHORITIES IN MANY
WAYS. FOR ONE THING, THEY HAVE A CAPTIVE
AUDIENCE FOR RE-EDUCATION PROGRAMMES.
IT MAY BE TRUE THAT MOST EAST TIMORESE
SHOW NO INCLINATION TO LEAVE THE SETTLEMENTS.
BUT THAT IS WHERE THE RELIEF AID IS DISTRIBUTED
IN THE WAKE OF FAMINE. IT MAY BE TRUE, TOO,
THAT INDONESIAN MILITARY OFFICERS SHOW A "GOOD
APPRECIATION OF THE NEED TO MOVE SLOWLY AND TO
UNDERSTAND LOCAL CONDITIONS". BUT TRADITIONALLY
HOSTILE TRIBES OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES HAVE BEEN
FORCED TO LIVE TOGETHER, AND SOME TRIBES FROM
THE MOUNTAINS, ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENTS,
HAVE BEEN SENT TO SEA LEVEL, "WHERE THEY APPEAR
TO BE TOTALLY CONFUSED AND ALIENATED FROM THEIR
NEW ENVIRONMENT".
IN THE FACE OF THIS EVIDENCE, IT MAY BE
ARGUED THAT THE INDONESIANS ARE NOT LIVING UP
TO THE ENORMOUS OBLIGATIONS THEY ASSUMED BY
INVADING EAST TIMOR AND FORCING DRASTIC
READJUSTMENTS ON A SOCIETY. THERE IS A CLEAR
CASE FOR COMPASSION IN ITS BROADEST SENSE.
ABOVE ALL, THE EAST TIMORESE MUST HAVE A SAY
IN THEIR DESTINY. AND AUSTRALIA, WHICH CANNOT
LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE ON ITS ROLE IN THE COUNTRY'S
TRAGEDY, HAS ITS OWN MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO
ENSURE THAT THIS IS SO.
"TRANSPORT AND MONEY MATTERS"
EARLY IN THE NEW YEAR, THE FIRST SECTION OF
MELBOURNE'S UNDERGROUND RAIL LOOP WILL BE
OPENED. IN ENGINEERING AND DESIGN TERMS, THE
LOOP IS AN IMPRESSIVE SCHEME. ITS THREE NEW
CITY STATIONS SHOULD EASE THE DELAYS THAT AFFLICT
PEAK HOUR RAIL SERVICES, AND ENCOURAGE OFFICE
AND RETAIL DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY'S NORTHERN
WASTELANDS. BUT THE LOOP, WHICH WAS TO HAVE
COST $80 MILLION WHEN CONSTRUCTION BEGAN A
DECADE AGO, IS NOW LIKELY TO COST ABOUT $1500
MILLION IN LOAN REPAYMENTS AND INTEREST. AS
WELL, THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS THAT REASONABLY
CAN BE EXPECTED TO USE IT EACH DAY HAS NOT
DOUBLED, AS THE LOOP'S PROMOTERS FORECAST IN
1970, BUT FALLEN BY ABOUT 30 PER CENT. IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENT,
GIVEN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD HAVE
ATTEMPTED TO BOOST RAIL PATRONAGE SO AS TO
MAXIMISE THE LOOP'S USEFULNESS. INSTEAD, ON THE
EVE OF THE LOOP'S OPENING, IT IS GIVING SERIOUS
CONSIDERATION TO A REPORT THAT RECOMMENDS THE
CLOSURE OF MUCH OF THE SUBURBAN RAIL NETWORK
THAT THE LOOP WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO
COMPLEMENT.
THE REPORT, COMPILED BY THE VICTORIAN
TRANSPORT STUDY GROUP LED BY A FORMER BHP
EXECUTIVE, MR MURRAY LONIE, ADVOCATES THE
CLOSURE OF EIGHT SUBURBAN RAIL LINES AND SEVEN
TRAM ROUTES. THE REASON IT GIVES IS ECONOMICS.
IN FACT, IT APPEARS THE STUDY GROUP CONSIDERED
LITTLE ELSE. THE REPORT SAYS, IN ESSENCE, THAT THE
STATE HAS LET ITS PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM RUN
DOWN TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT PASSENGERS ARE
DESERTING IT AND, AS A RESULT, THAT OPERATING
LOSSES HAVE BECOME INTOLERABLE. (THE LOSSES THIS
YEAR WILL EXCEED $200 MILLION.) IT SAYS THAT IN
ORDER TO CUT THE LOSSES, THE MOST UNECONOMIC
SERVICES SHOULD BE SCRAPPED. IF MONEY WAS THE
SOLE CONSIDERATION, SUCH A RECOMMENDATION
COULD BE SEEN AS REASONABLE. BUT THERE IS MUCH
MORE AT STAKE.
OF COURSE, THERE IS THE LOOP. WITHOUT THE
PASSENGERS FROM ALMOST 50 STATIONS ON THE RAIL
LINES NOW RECOMMENDED FOR CLOSURE, IT EASILY
COULD BECOME A WHITE ELEPHANT. THOSE SAME
PASSENGERS WOULD BE FORCED TO TAKE TO THE
ROADS, IN EITHER CARS OR BUSES, THUS INCREASING
OIL CONSUMPTION AT A TIME WHEN FEDERAL AND
STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE TRYING TO CONSERVE
SHRINKING RESERVES OF LIQUID FUEL, AND
AGGRAVATING TRAFFIC CONGESTION. THERE IS ALSO
THE QUESTION OF THE COMMUNITY'S NEEDS. ALREADY
THERE ARE TOO MANY SUBURBS IN WHICH SCHOOL
CHILDREN, HOUSEWIVES, THE ELDERLY AND THE POOR
HAVE THEIR MOBILITY RESTRICTED BY LACK OF PUBLIC
TRANSPORT. WHILE THERE MIGHT BE A CASE
FOR REDUCING SERVICES IN AREAS WHERE TRAIN AND
TRAM ROUTES DUPLICATE ONE ANOTHER, AS ALONG THE
CORRIDOR BETWEEN THE CITY AND ST. KILDA,
ABANDONMENT OF SERVICES AS RECOMMENDED IN
THE LONIE REPORT IS DANGEROUSLY SHORT-SIGHTED.
WHAT WILL FUTURE GENERATIONS DO WHEN THE OIL
RUNS OUT? FOR THAT MATTER, HOW WILL OUR SOCIETY
COPE IF OIL BECOMES SO SCARCE AND SO EXPENSIVE
IN THE MID-1980S THAT THE USE OF PRIVATE CARS
BECOMES A LUXURY? THE ANSWER TO RISING PUBLIC
TRANSPORT LOSSES IS NOT TO ABANDON THE SERVICES
IN DESPAIR. IT IS TO LURE MORE PEOPLE OUT OF
THEIR CARS WITH BETTER AND MORE RELIABLE
SERVICES, REDUCE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT WORKFORCE
AND CHARGE FARES THAT MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT
THE COST OF THE SERVICE. INSTEAD OF SCRAPPING
TRAINS AND TRAMS, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD SCRAP
THE LONIE REPORT.
<F49>
THURSDAY 20 NOVEMBER 1980
"SECOND THOUGHTS ON STRIKE LAW"
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO DELAY
ITS PROMISED LEGISLATION TO FACILITATE SECRET
STRIKE BALLOTS AND UNION AMALGAMATIONS HAS BEEN
INTERPRETED AS A VICTORY FOR THE NEW INDUSTRIAL
RELATIONS MINISTER, MR PEACOCK. IT IS CERTAINLY A
VICTORY FOR COMMON SENSE, IF THE GOVERNMENT'S
AIM IS TO REDUCE INDUSTRIAL STRIFE RATHER THAN TO
SCORE POLITICAL POINTS. MR PEACOCK URGED THE
DELAY IN AN ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE THE CONSULTATIVE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT, UNIONS
AND EMPLOYERS. THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION, IF IT IS
TO HAVE ANY VALUE AT ALL, SHOULD BE BASED SO FAR
AS POSSIBLE ON AGREEMENT RATHER THAN BE IMPOSED
ON A RESISTANT TRADE UNION MOVEMENT. THE
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MUCH TOO INCLINED IN THE
PAST TO RESORT TO LEGISLATION TO SOLVE INDUSTRIAL
PROBLEMS, ONLY TO FIND THAT THE LAWS THEMSELVES
PROVOKED MORE TROUBLE OR WERE TOO DRACONIAN
TO BE ENFORCEABLE. RAISING PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS
THAT TOUGH LAWS CAN STOP STRIKES AND THEN BEING
UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO ENFORCE THEM DOES
NOTHING EITHER TO IMPROVE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
OR TO ESTABLISH POLITICAL CREDIBILITY.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS LONG HAD A FAITH IN
THE EFFICACY OF SECRET BALLOTS TO REDUCE THE
INCIDENCE OR DURATION OF STRIKES THAT HAS NOT
BEEN CONFIRMED BY EXPERIENCE. THIS FAITH SEEMS
TO STEM FROM THE NOTION THAT STRIKES ARE
FORMENTED BY A FEW MILITANT, OFTEN COMMUNIST,
TRADE UNION LEADERS AND IMPOSED ON A RELUCTANT
MEMBERSHIP. THIS CONSPIRATORIAL THEORY DOES NOT
EXPLAIN WHY THESE LEADERS MANAGE TO RETAIN THE
CONFIDENCE OF THE RANK AND FILE AND IGNORES THE
EVIDENCE THAT IN MANY DISPUTES THE WORKERS ON
THE JOB ARE MORE MILITANT OR INTRANSIGENT THAN
THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS. THE PRACTICAL DRAWBACK
OF SECRET BALLOT LEGISLATION IS THAT SUCH POLLS
TAKE TIME TO ORGANISE AND, IF THE WORKERS VOTE
FOR A STRIKE OR ITS CONTINUATION, A DISPUTE WILL
GAIN LEGITIMACY AND BECOME MUCH HARDER TO
SETTLE.
FORTUNATELY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS REALISED
THAT MANDATORY BALLOTS HAVE LITTLE PROSPECT OF
REDUCING INDUSTRIAL DISRUPTION. ITS PROPOSED
LEGISLATION HAS THE RATHER MORE MODEST AIM OF
ALLOWING WORKERS ON THE SHOP FLOOR TO PETITION
FOR SECRET BALLOTS ON STRIKE ACTION. THERE CAN
BE NO VALID OBJECTION TO THIS IN PRINCIPLE, BUT
THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH SUCH A PROVISION
WOULD BE USED ARE LIKELY TO BE SO LIMITED AS TO
RAISE DOUBTS WHETHER THE LEGISLATION IS REALLY
NEEDED. AS IT IS UNLIKELY TO MAKE MUCH PRACTICAL
DIFFERENCE TO THE LEVEL OF INDUSTRIAL STRIFE, THE
GOVERNMENT CAN AFFORD TO WAIT. IT WOULD BE FAR
BETTER IF MR PEACOCK COULD PERSUADE THE UNIONS
TO INTRODUCE MORE DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES
THEMSELVES.
THE AIM OF MAKING UNION AMALGAMATIONS
EASIER BY REDUCING THE PROPORTION OF UNIONISTS
REQUIRED TO APPROVE SUCH A MOVE FROM 50 PER
CENT TO 25 PER CENT IS ONE WITH WHICH THE ACTU
AGREES IN PRINCIPLE. ALTHOUGH AMALGAMATION CAN
CREATE MORE POWERFUL UNIONS, IT HAS OFFSETTING
ADVANTAGES. FEWER UNIONS SHOULD MEAN FEWER
DEMARCATION DISPUTES, WHICH HAVE LED TO SOME
EXTREMELY BITTER AND DAMAGING STOPPAGES
RECENTLY. A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF UNIONS
MIGHT ALSO LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER
OF INDUSTRIAL AWARDS, WITH FEWER OPPORTUNITIES
FOR LEAP-FROGGING CLAIMS AND EXPENSIVE FLOW-ONS.
BUT AGAIN, SUCH LEGISLATION SHOULD BE BASED ON
NEGOTIATION AND A LARGE MEASURE OF AGREEMENT.
THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSALS, ANNOUNCED DURING
THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN, APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN
CONCOCTED AS MORE OF A VOTE-CATCHER THAN A
GENUINE ATTEMPT TO CURB INDUSTRIAL DISRUPTION.
MR PEACOCK SHOULD NOW REVISE THEM, TOGETHER
WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S ARSENAL OF OTHER INDUSTRIAL
LEGISLATION OF DUBIOUS VALUE, AND TRY TO ACHIEVE
IN CONSULTATION WITH THE UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS
A MORE PRACTICAL AND ACCEPTABLE APPROACH TO
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.
"A SURFEIT OF CRICKET"
A LOT HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN THE PAST FEW
YEARS ABOUT MODERN CRICKET. SCORNFUL
TRADITIONALISTS RUE THE DAY THAT THE GAME SOLD
OUT TO COMMERCIAL INTERESTS AND MARKETING WHIZ-
KIDS. BOASTFUL PROGRESSIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND,
CONTEND THAT SUPER-HEROES IN GAILY COLORED CLOTHES
AND FUNNY HATS, COMPETING ALMOST EVERY OTHER
DAY FOR SOME CUP OR OTHER, ARE MORE LIKELY TO
ATTRACT TELEVISION RATINGS, BIGGER CROWDS, AND
SPONSORSHIP FUNDS THAN THE UNASSUMING
FLANNELED FOOLS OF OLD. BOTH SIDES PRESENT SOME
VALID ARGUMENTS. THERE IS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR
RETAINING THE TRADITIONAL SPIRIT OF THE GAME AND
THE UNAFFECTED SPONTANEITY OF THE CONTEST.
EQUALLY, HOWEVER, THERE IS A NEED TO MAKE THE
GAME BRIGHTER SO AS TO BEAT OFF THE ADVANCE OF
TENNIS AND GOLF AS SPECTATOR AND SPONSORSHIP
DRAWCARDS.
PERHAPS INEVITABLY, IT IS TAKING TIME TO
FIND A SATISFACTORY COMPROMISE. CERTAINLY,
INTERNATIONAL CRICKET IS MUCH RICHER THESE DAYS,
THANKS TO BIG SPONSORSHIP DEALS. ONE-DAY
INTERNATIONAL MATCHES APPEAR TO HAVE FOUND A
NICHE. BUT THESE GAINS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE
AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER KINDS OF CRICKET, NOT OF
OTHER SPORTS. ATTENDANCES AT SHEFFIELD SHIELD
INTERSTATE CRICKET MATCHES HAVE FALLEN, AND
TELEVISION AND RADIO COVERAGE OF THE GAMES IS
GRUDGING. THE COMPETITION, WHICH USED TO BE
REGARDED AS ONE OF THE PREMIER DOMESTIC CRICKET
TOURNAMENTS IN THE WORLD AND ATTRACTED BIG
CROWDS AS WELL AS DIRECT COVERAGE BY ABC RADIO
AND TELEVISION, HAS BECOME A POORLY ATTENDED,
LACKLUSTRE SHOW.
THE ABC, PIQUED BY ITS LOSS LAST YEAR OF
TELEVISION RIGHTS TO INTERNATIONAL CRICKET TO THE
WEALTHIER NINE NETWORK, DECLINED TO TELEVISE
SHIELD MATCHES, AND NOW CONCENTRATES ON BIG
GOLF TOURNAMENTS DURING SPRING AND SUMMER. ITS
RADIO DIVISION NOW GIVES THE SHIELD SCANT
ATTENTION. CHANNEL NINE, CONTENT WITH ITS RIGHTS
TO INTERNATIONAL CRICKET, TREATS THE SHIELD AS AN
AFTERTHOUGHT. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE
NETWORK'S LACK OF INTEREST MIGHT WELL BE SIMILAR
TO WHAT IS SEEN AS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR
THE SHIELD'S DECLINE. JUST AS THE NINE NETWORK
DOES NOT HAVE THE TIME OR EQUIPMENT TO COVER
SHIELD GAMES BECAUSE OF ITS COMMITMENT TO
EVERYTHING FROM THE TEST SERIES AGAINST NEW
ZEALAND AND INDIA TO INTERNATIONAL AND INTERSTATE
ONE-DAY CONTESTS, SO TOO DO SPECTATORS FACE A
SURFEIT OF CRICKET.
IN MELBOURNE ALONE THIS SUMMER THERE ARE TO
BE 38 DAYS OF INTERNATIONAL AND INTERSTATE GAMES
AT THE MCG. ADD TO THAT THE DAY AND NIGHT
CRICKET BEAMED INTO LIVINGROOMS BY THE NINE
NETWORK AND IT CAN BE APPRECIATED THAT
SPECTATORS, EVEN THE MOST ARDENT, WILL NEED TO
SET A FEW SOCIAL PRIORITIES. SADLY, IT IS THE SHIELD
SERIES, WHICH HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY THE PROVING
GROUND FOR YOUNG PLAYERS, THAT SEEMS LIKELY TO
BE RELEGATED. SURELY IT IS TIME THE SPORT'S
ADMINISTRATORS TOOK STOCK. ILL-ADVISED MODERNITY
CAN BE JUST AS DAMAGING AS OBSTINATE
TRADITIONALISM. CRICKET CANNOT AFFORD TO CUT ITSELF
COMPLETELY OFF FROM THE PAST, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE
TRADITION NOW IN JEOPARDY, THE SHIELD COMPETITION,
IS ALSO THE FOUNDATION OF OUR CRICKETING FUTURE.

FRIDAY 21 NOVEMBER 1980
"HOW TO PLUCK A GOOSE"
THE ART OF TAXATION, AS LOUIS XIV'S BRILLIANT
FINANCE MINISTER COLBERT OBSERVED, "CONSISTS
IN SO PLUCKING THE GOOSE AS TO OBTAIN THE
MOST FEATHERS WITH THE LEAST HISSING". THE
SOUND OF HISSING HAS BEEN LONG AND LOUD FROM
SECTIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY WHO
FEEL THEY ARE BEING PLUCKED TOO ROUGHLY OR
RAPACIOUSLY. ALTHOUGH THE OVERALL TAX YIELD IS
RELATIVELY LOWER IN AUSTRALIA THAN IN MOST
OTHER ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES, AUSTRALIA
RELIES MORE HEAVILY ON INCOME TAX.
THE EXPECTATIONS AROUSED BY THE FRASER
GOVERNMENT THAT IT WOULD REDUCE INCOME TAX
HAVE NOT BEEN SATISFIED, AND GROWTH OF TAX
AVOIDANCE HAS INCREASED THE BURDEN ON WAGE
AND SALARY EARNERS. THE WIDESPREAD FEELING THAT
INCOME TAX IS TOO HIGH AND OFFICIAL REALISATION
THAT THE OIL LEVY BONANZA CANNOT LAST HAVE
PROMPTED THE GOVERNMENT TO REVIVE PROPOSALS
FOR A BROADLY BASED TAX ON CONSUMPTION, SUCH
AS VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT). THIS SUGGESTION HAS
PROVOKED A FRESH FLURRY OF HISSING FROM THOSE
WHO, FOR IDEOLOGICAL OR PRACTICAL REASONS, REGARD
VAT AS EVEN MORE INQUITIOUS THAN HIGH INCOME
TAX.
SO NOW THE TREASURER, MR HOWARD, HAS
CALLED FOR YET ANOTHER REVIEW OF THE AUSTRALIAN
TAX SYSTEM. THIS IS SENSIBLE, EVEN THOUGH THE
REPORT OF THE ASPREY COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO
THE TAX SYSTEM SITS IGNORED ON THE SHELF. THE
ASPREY REPORT WAS PROBABLY TOO ACADEMIC, AND
NOW IS OUT-DATED. TAXATION SHOULD BE REVIEWED
REGULARLY TO ENSURE THAT IT MEETS CHANGING NEEDS
AND CIRCUMSTANCES. MR HOWARD HAS DECLARED -
ALTHOUGH SCEPTICS MAY SUGGEST THAT HISTORY
SHOWS OTHERWISE - THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS
NO WISH TO INCREASE THE TOTAL TAX YIELD BUT
SIMPLY TO REDISTRIBUTE THE BURDEN MORE FAIRLY
AND EFFECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH PEOPLE WHO CALL FOR
TAX REFORM GENERALLY WANT MERELY TO REDUCE
THEIR OWN LOAD AND TRANSFER IT TO SOMEONE ELSE,
SINCE THE PROSPECT OF SUBSTANTIALLY CUTTING BACK
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE HAS PROVED TO BE
ILLUSORY, IT IS A PITY THAT THE PROPOSED REVIEW
OF TAX OPTIONS IS TO BE MADE BY THE TAXATION
DEPARTMENT, WITHOUT INDEPENDENT INPUT.
BUREAUCRACY TENDS TO FAVOR FORMS OF TAXATION
WHICH IT FINDS CONVENIENT TO COLLECT, A CRITERION
THAT SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN TOO MUCH WEIGHT.
IN A MODERN SOCIETY, TAXATION HAS SEVERAL
LEGITIMATE FUNCTIONS: TO RAISE REVENUE, TO
REDISTRIBUTE INCOMES AND TO SERVE AS AN
INSTRUMENT OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. EACH
FORM OF TAXATION SHOULD BE REASONABLY EFFICIENT
IN ITS ADMINISTRATION AND EQUITABLE IN ITS
APPLICATION. IT SHOULD SERVE TO ENCOURAGE
ACTIVITY DEEMED TO BE SOCIALLY OR ECONOMICALLY
DESIRABLE AND DISCOURAGE THOSE THAT ARE NOT.
THE TOTAL TAX MIX SHOULD BE WELL-BALANCED,
INTEGRATED, RATIONAL AND FLEXIBLE. SOME TAXES,
SUCH AS PAYROLL TAX, HAVE BECOME ENTRENCHED
LONG BEYOND THEIR JUSTIFICATION; NEW TAXES, SUCH
AS A RESOURCES RENT TAX, ARE NOTORIOUSLY HARD
TO INTRODUCE. GOVERNMENTS ARE ALWAYS LOATH TO
GIVE UP A LUCRATIVE ESTABLISHED SOURCE OF
REVENUE AND POTENTIAL TAXPAYERS WILL ALWAYS
RESIST A NEW IMPOST THAT WOULD FALL ON THEM.
THE GOVERNMENT FACES TWO PRESSING
PROBLEMS: TO FIND AN ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE TO
THE PRESENT HIGH LEVEL OF PERSONAL TAXATION
AND TO FIND AN EVENTUAL SUBSTITUTE FOR THE
BOOMING OIL LEVY. AUSTRALIA'S PROGRESSIVE INCOME
TAX IS NO LONGER EFFICIENT OR EQUITABLE (IN THE
SENSE OF TREATING TAXPAYERS IN SIMILAR
CIRCUMSTANCES EQUALLY). TOO MANY CONCESSIONS
ARE OPEN TO PARTICULAR CLASSES OF TAXPAYER, AND
TOO MANY LOOPHOLES EXIST FOR AVOIDANCE. INDEED,
THE ABSENCE OF A WEALTH OR CAPITAL GAINS TAX
AND THE PHASING OUT OF DEATH DUTIES, TOGETHER
WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCOME TAX AVOIDANCE,
ARE LIKELY TO WIDEN THE GAP BETWEEN THE RICH
AND POOR ENORMOUSLY OVER THE NEXT FEW
GENERATIONS IF THE IMBALANCE IS NOT REDRESSED.
LACK OF A CAPITAL GAINS TAX ALSO DISTORTS
THE BEST USE OF RESOURCES, ENCOURAGING EXCESSIVE
INVESTMENT IN PROPERTY AND DISCOURAGING MORE
PRODUCTIVE FORMS OF INVESTMENT. THE GOVERNMENT
SHOULD SEEK AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ELIMINATING
TAX AVOIDANCE AND SERIOUSLY CONSIDER A FORM
OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX. THIS APPROACH WOULD BE
PREFERABLE TO A GREATER EMPHASIS ON SOME NEW
FORM OF CONSUMPTION TAX WHICH, ALTHOUGH IT
SHOULD NOT BE RULED OUT, IS LIKELY TO BE MORE
REGRESSIVE AND TO ADD TO INFLATION. THE IMPACT
OF HIGHER INDIRECT TAX WOULD HAVE TO BE OFFSET
BY A REVIEW OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS AND THE
ARBITRATION SYSTEM (TO AVOID, SO FAR AS POSSIBLE,
THE HIGHER COST OF LIVING FUELLING INFLATIONARY
WAGE RISES).
THE MOST APPROPRIATE SUCCESSOR TO THE OIL
LEVY IS A RESOURCES TAX SO PITCHED AS NOT TO
DISCOURAGE EXPLORATION BUT TO ENSURE THAT THE
AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY DERIVES THE MAIN BENEFIT
FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF ITS DIMINISHING NATURAL
ASSETS. THE STATES SHOULD ALSO BE PRESSED TO
CHARGE REALISTIC PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SUPPLIED
TO ALUMINIUM SMELTERS; THE ALCOA AGREEMENT IN
VICTORIA REPRESENTS AN UNDERPRICED EXPORT OF
AUSTRALIAN ENERGY. A RESOURCES TAX WOULD NOT
WHOLLY COMPENSATE FOR THE DECLINE OF THE OIL
LEVY, BUT IT SHOULD BE ACCEPTED AS THE ESSENTIAL
CORE OF A NEW STRUCTURE. THE TAXATION
DEPARTMENT SHOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN
OFFERING THE GOVERNMENT A RATIONAL RANGE OF
OPTIONS. THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE POLITICAL ONE
OF REDISTRIBUTING THE TAX BURDEN FAIRLY AND
EFFECTIVELY. THE GOVERNMENT FEARS NOT JUST THE
HISSING BUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT TOO RADICAL A
RESTRUCTURING COULD COOK ITS OWN GOOSE.
<F51>
TUESDAY 25 NOVEMBER 1980
"MR SINCLAIR AND THE AIRWAVES"
"THE GOVERNMENT, BELIEVING IN A FREE
ENTERPRISE ECONOMY, KNOWS THAT PROTECTION
OF THAT ECONOMY AT TIMES REQUIRES MEASURES TO
BE TAKEN AGAINST MONOPOLISTIC AND RESTRICTIVE
TENDENCIES. THIS AREA OF MASS COMMUNICATIONS
IS ONE IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY
TAKEN THE STAND THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE UNDUE
AGGREGATION OF POWER IN THE HANDS OF ANY FEW."
THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN IN FEDERAL
PARLIAMENT ON 12 MAY 1960 BY MR C. W.
DAVIDSON, POSTMASTER-GENERAL IN THE LIBERAL
MENZIES GOVERNMENT. MR DAVIDSON WAS
EXPLAINING TO THE HOUSE WHY THE GOVERNMENT
FOUND IT NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE TOUGH
LEGISLATION RESTRICTING THE CONCENTRATION OF MEDIA
OWNERSHIP IN AUSTRALIA.
IN 1977, THE FRASER GOVERNMENT DECIDED
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONTROL OF
COMMERCIAL RADIO AND TELEVISION SHOULD BE IN
THE HANDS OF AN INDEPENDENT BODY. INTRODUCING
LEGISLATION TO EFFECT THAT CHANGE, THE THEN POST
AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS MINISTER, MR ERIC
ROBINSON, SAID ON 13 OCTOBER 1977: "THE
PRINCIPLE OF A BROADCASTING SYSTEM NOT SUBJECT
TO POLITICAL INTERFERENCE IS ONE OF THE BASIC AIMS
OF THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. THE MAJOR
ELEMENT OF THE CHANGES AIMED AT DEPOLITICISING
THE BROADCASTING SYSTEM IS THE TRANSFER OF
LICENSING POWER FROM THE MINISTER TO THE
AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING TRIBUNAL". IN THE SAME
SPEECH, MR ROBINSON DESCRIBED THE BROADCASTING
FREQUENCY SPECTRUM AS "A VALUABLE PUBLIC
RESOURCE". THE TRIBUNAL WAS CHARGED WITH
CONSIDERING THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE
ADMINISTRATION OF THAT PUBLIC RESOURCE.
NOW, HOWEVER, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS
REPORTED TO BE THINKING ABOUT EMASCULATING THE
TRIBUNAL'S PUBLIC INTEREST POWER BY WATERING
DOWN THE BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION ACT. AT
PRESENT, UNDER THE ACT, THE TRIBUNAL CAN PREVENT
A COMPANY FROM BUYING A TELEVISION STATION IF
IT "CONSIDERS IT NECESSARY TO DO SO TO MAINTAIN
SUCH OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL AS BEST ACCORDS
WITH THE PUBLIC INTEREST". THIS IS A WISE
PROVISION. THE AIRWAVES, AS MR ROBINSON
OBSERVED ONLY THREE YEARS AGO ON BEHALF OF THE
FRASER GOVERNMENT, ARE NOT ANYONE'S PRIVATE
PROPERTY. IT FOLLOWS THAT A REGULATORY SYSTEM IS
REQUIRED. IT ALSO FOLLOWS THAT THE SYSTEM MUST
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND EXAMINE THE INTERESTS OF
THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AND NOT MERELY HAND OUT
LICENCES ON COMMERCIAL GROUNDS. TELEVISION
PLAYS A POWERFUL ROLE IN FORGING COMMUNITY
ATTITUDES. IT FOLLOWS, AGAIN, THAT IN A
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY THE POWER THAT TELEVISION
CONFERS SHOULD BE AS WIDELY DISPERSED AS
POSSIBLE, NOT CONCENTRATED IN "THE HANDS OF ANY
FEW".
THE LATE LORD THOMSON, IN AN UNGUARDED
MOMENT, ONCE DESCRIBED THE HOLDING OF A MAJOR
TELEVISION LICENCE AS "A LICENCE TO PRINT MONEY".
THIS COMMERCIAL REALITY MEANS THAT IT IS EVEN
MORE IMPORTANT FOR LICENCES TO BE HANDED OUT
WITH GREAT CARE, AND HANDED OUT BY AN
INDEPENDENT BODY. THE PRESENT PUBLIC INTEREST
POWERS OF THE TRIBUNAL MEAN THAT THE ALLOCATION
OF LICENCES IS BEYOND POLITICAL PRESSURE. IT THUS
REDUCES THE SCOPE FOR POWERFUL MEDIA GROUPS
TO EXTRACT FAVORS FROM GOVERNMENTS IN RETURN
FOR PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT ON THE (PUBLIC)
AIRWAVES, OR INDEED IN NEWSPAPERS. IT ALSO
REDUCES THE SCOPE FOR GOVERNMENTS TO HAND OUT
LICENCES TO THEIR FRIENDS, IN RETURN FOR FUTURE
FAVORS. ALL THIS IS SO OBVIOUS, AND WAS SO
CLEARLY RECOGNISED BY THE FRASER GOVERNMENT
ONLY THREE YEARS AGO, THAT WE WONDER WHAT IS
CAUSING THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE SECOND
THOUGHTS ABOUT ITS OWN BROADCASTING AND
TELEVISION ACT. WHAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY THAT
MIGHT HAVE INSPIRED THESE THOUGHTS? ONLY TWO
THINGS, SO FAR AS WE KNOW.
ON 26 SEPTEMBER THIS YEAR THE TRIBUNAL
EXERCISED ITS PUBLIC INTEREST POWER WHEN IT
BLOCKED A MOVE BY MR RUPERT MURDOCH'S NEWS
GROUP TO BUY INTO THE MELBOURNE TV STATION
ATV-10. THE TRIBUNAL FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT
IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST FOR THE NEWS GROUP TO
DOMINATE THE NATIONAL TEN TELEVISION NETWOR
BY CONTROLLING ATV-10. NEWS ALREADY OWNED
TEN-10 SYDNEY, THE ONLY OTHER BIG STATION IN
THE NETWORK WHICH IS SPREAD OVER FOUR
CAPITAL CITIES. THE NEWS GROUP HAS APPEALED
AGAINST THAT DECISION.
THE OTHER THING THAT HAS HAPPENED IS THE
APPOINTMENT OF A NEW MINISTER FOR
COMMUNICATIONS, MR IAN SINCLAIR. CAN IT REALLY
BE THAT MR SINCLAIR IS THINKING OF WAYS TO
REVERSE THE POLICIES OF HIS TWO PREDECESSORS, MR
DAVIDSON AND MR ROBINSON?
"ASSIMILATING THE REFUGEES"
AUSTRALIA SHOULD BE PROUD OF ITS RECORD IN
RESETTLING INDO-CHINESE REFUGEES. ABOUT
43,000 REFUGEES ALREADY HAVE BEEN GRANTED
RESIDENCE HERE, AND ANOTHER 14,500 ARE DUE TO
ARRIVE THIS FINANCIAL YEAR. ALL TOLD, AUSTRALIA
HAS TAKEN ABOUT ONE IN NINE OF THE 377,217
WHOM THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER
FOR REFUGEES SAYS HAVE FLED INDO-CHINA AND
SURVIVED THE ARDUOUS JOURNEY TO NEIGHBORING
NON-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, USUALLY IN
OVERCROWDED BOATS, IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS.
GENERALLY, THE NEW ARRIVALS HAVE SETTLED INTO
AUSTRALIAN LIFE MUCH FASTER THAN ANYONE
EXPECTED. IN FACT, SOME SOCIAL WORKERS IN
MELBOURNE SAY THE INDO-CHINESE ARE BECOMING
AUSTRALIA'S MOST SUCCESSFULLY RESETTLED ETHNIC
GROUP.
MUCH OF THE CREDIT MUST GO TO THE REFUGEES
THEMSELVES. THE MAJORITY HAVE DISPLAYED A
KEENNESS TO FIND WORK, DESPITE THE FACT THAT
MANY HAVE HAD THEIR EXISTING QUALIFICATIONS
REJECTED AND HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ACCEPT JOBS
WHICH NORMALLY THEY WOULD CONSIDER BELOW
THEIR DIGNITY. THEIR CHILDREN ARE SAID TO BE
RELISHING THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED
IN OUR SCHOOLS. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT FACTOR,
HOWEVER, APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE EFFORT MADE
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PREPARE THE
REFUGEES FOR EVERYDAY LIFE DURING THEIR AVERAGE
FIVE-MONTH STAY IN MIGRANT HOSTELS AFTER
ARRIVING HERE. THE REFUGEES ARE TAUGHT ENGLISH
DURING A CONCENTRATED 10-WEEK COURSE. THEY
ARE ALSO GIVEN ADVICE ON BANKING, HEALTH
INSURANCE, SCHOOLS, SOCIAL WELFARE ENTITLEMENTS
AND SHOPPING. THE PROGRAMME SEEMS TO HAVE
SUCCEEDED.
OF COURSE, SOME SAY THE PROGRAMME HAS
ITS FAULTS. ONE CONTENTION IS THAT IT NEGLECTS
MOST REFUGEES ONCE THEY LEAVE THE HOSTELS. BUT
THERE IS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR ENCOURAGING THEM
TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
ANOTHER PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE IN FUNDING THE
PROGRAMME. THE INDO-CHINESE REFUGEE
ASSOCIATION SAID LAST WEEK THAT FEDERAL FUNDS
FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE CLASSES IN THE MIGRANT
HOSTELS WERE RUNNING OUT, AND THAT THE DURATION
OF THE CLASSES WOULD HAVE TO BE CUT. THE
DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS,
WICH DENIES THAT THE NUMBER OF LESSONS IN THE
COURSE WILL BE CUT, NONETHELESS IS SEEKING
SUPPLEMENTARY FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL
CAUSED BY AN UNEXPECTED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER
OF REFUGEES COMING TO AUSTRALIA IN 1980-81. THE
SUM REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE PRESENT HIGH
STANDARD OF LANGUAGE TEACHING IS NOT KNOWN.
BUT IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE MONEY CAN BE
FOUND. AFTER ASSIMILATING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
REFUGEES WITH FEW OF THE TRAUMAS EXPERIENCED
BY OTHER COUNTRIES, IT WOULD BE A PITY IF
AUSTRALIA SUDDENLY RELAXED ITS EFFORTS.
<F52>
WEDNESDAY 26 NOVEMBER 1980
"THE ITALIAN TRAGEDY"
ON SUNDAY EVENING, ABOUT 300 PEOPLE WERE
ATTENDING MASS IN THE CHURCH OF OUR LADY
OF THE ASSUMPTION IN THE SOUTHERN ITALIAN VILLAGE
OF BALVANO. IT WAS A SPECIAL MASS. BALVANO'S
PRIEST, FATHER SALVATORE PAGLIUCA, ORGANISED IT
TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE CHURCH'S MISSIONARY WORK
AMONG THE NEEDY. SUDDENLY, AS THE SERVICE DREW
TO A CLOSE, THERE WAS A RUMBLE, THEN A ROAR, AND
THE WALLS OF THE 900-YEAR-OLD CHURCH BEGAN TO
CRUMBLE. OUTSIDE, BLINDING CLOUDS OF DUST ROSE
AS THE EARTH BLISTERED AND CRACKED. FINALLY, AS
THE PARISHIONERS FLED FROM THE CHURCH, THE
BUILDING COLLAPSED. MORE THAN 50 ARE SAID TO
HAVE BEEN CRUSHED TO DEATH UNDER THE FALLING
MASONRY. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, AFTER THE
WORST EARTHQUAKE IN SOUTHERN ITALY SINCE 1930,
MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE IN SANT' ANGELO DEI
LOMBARDI AND ABOUT 700 PEOPLE IN A HUNDRED
OTHER VILLAGES, TOWNS AND CITIES WERE DEAD.
THE EARTHQUAKE, WHICH FATHER PAGLIUCA
DESCRIBED AS THE WILL OF GOD, COST MORE THAN
THE LIVES OF 1000 OR SO PEOPLE. ITALIAN AUTHORITIES
REPORTED YESTERDAY THAT MANY THOUSANDS HAD
BEEN INJURED, AND THAT EIGHT OUT OF EVERY 10
BUILDINGS IN THE DISASTER ZONE HAD BEEN WRECKED
OR DAMAGED. IT IS FORTUNATE THAT MORE WERE NOT
KILLED. OBVIOUSLY, MANY ITALIANS AND THEIR
FAMILIES LIVING IN AUSTRALIA HAVE TAKEN
A SPECIAL INTEREST IN NEWS REPORTS OF THE
TRAGEDY. MANY OTHER AUSTRALIANS, TOO, FEEL
AN AFFINITY TO THE EARTHQUAKE'S SURVIVORS,
HAVING VISITED NAPLES AND SALERNO, THE TWO
BIGGEST CITIES IN THE AREA, ON HOLIDAY. THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ACTED WITH ADMIRABLE
SPEED IN ANNOUNCING THAT AUSTRALIAN AID WILL GO
TO THE SURVIVORS. IT WILL ALSO RELAX IMMIGRATION
RULES TO ALLOW VICTIMS WITH RELATIVES IN AUSTRALIA
TO EMIGRATE QUICKLY. TOGETHER WITH FUNDS RAISED
BY PUBLIC APPEALS IN MELBOURNE AND SYDNEY, THE
GOVERNMENT'S ASSISTANCE SHOULD PROVIDE SOME
COMFORT TO THOSE WHO NOW MUST MAKE NEW
LIVES FOR THEMSELVES.
"POLAND'S PROBLEMS"
THE BIGGEST OF POLAND'S NEW UNIONS,
SOLIDARITY, HAS JOINED THE CHURCH AND THE
STATE AS A FORCE IN THE COUNTRY'S BALANCE OF
POWER. IT CLAIMS 10 MILLION MEMBERS,
UNDOUBTEDLY ENJOYS THE SYMPATHY OF AN
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF POLES AND HAS
ACHIEVED LEGITIMACY THROUGH AN EXTRAORDINARY
COMBINATION OF DARING, RESTRAINT AND
SOPHISTICATION. THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN
OBLIGED TO GRANT LEGAL AUTONOMY TO THE UNION
AND HAS CONCEDED EVEN THAT THE PHRASE FORMALLY
RECOGNISING "A LEADING ROLE FOR THE PARTY" BE
REMOVED FROM SOLIDARITY'S STATUTES. THE PROBLEM
WITH THIS NEW POLITICAL EQUATION IS THAT THE
SYSTEM PROVIDES NO CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
FOR NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE CENTRES OF POWER.
EACH SIDE HAS TO RELY IN THE END ON
BRINKMANSHIP. SOLIDARITY IS ARMED WITH ITS
ABILITY TO CALL A GENERAL STRIKE AND CRIPPLE AN
ALREADY PARLOUS ECONOMY. THE POLISH AUTHORITIES
ARE ARMED WITH THE THREAT OF SOVIET MILITARY
INTERVENTION.
FOR EITHER SIDE TO CALL THE OTHER'S BLUFF
WOULD BE A DANGEROUS GAME. SO THIS IS WHY
SOLIDARITY AND THE STATE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN
THE BUSINESS OF MUTUAL CONCESSIONS. HONOR HAS
BEEN PRESERVED ON BOTH SIDES TO DEFUSE, FOR THE
MOMENT, A MINEFIELD. OF COURSE, THE SOVIET
UNION NO DOUBT WOULD INTERVENE, NO MATTER
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES, IF IT THOUGHT THAT
EVENTS THREATENED TO DESTROY MOSCOW'S MILITARY
CONTROL OVER EASTERN EUROPE OR THE ONE-PARTY
SYSTEM. SOME IN THE SOVIET LEADERSHIP PROBABLY
FEEL THERE IS ENOUGH JUSTIFICATION ON EITHER
GROUND ALREADY. BUT THE CRUCIAL POINT WITH
POLAND IS THAT THE LEADERS IN WARSAW ARE
CONSULTING THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE KREMLIN
BEFORE ALL BIG DECISIONS. IT MAY BE THAT THE NEED
FOR DIRECT MILITARY INTERVENTION WILL BE AVERTED
AS LONG AS THE POLISH AUTHORITIES REMAIN IN CLEAR
CHARGE AND CONTINUE TO CO-OPERATE.
IN THIS CONTEXT IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING
THAT THE SOVIET INTERVENTIONS IN HUNGARY AND
CZECHOSLOVAKIA WERE THE RESULT OF
CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN MOSCOW AND THE
GOVERNMENTS IN BUDAPEST AND PRAGUE AND OF
THE DESIRE OF THE SOVIET UNION TO CHANGE THEIR
LEADERSHIPS. THIS IS NOT THE CASE IN POLAND,
WHERE THE PARTY'S FIRST SECRETARY, MR KANIA, HAS
BEEN LEFT TO HOLD THE LINE AND NO DOUBT TRY TO
SPLIT THE NEW UNION MOVEMENT. THIS POLICY
PROBABLY OWES MORE TO DEFAULT THAN DESIGN.
THE RUSSIANS CLEARLY DO NOT KNOW QUITE HOW TO
DEAL WITH THE DRAMATIC DEVELOPMENTS IN  POLAND
THIS YEAR. FOR THE MOST PART THEY HAVE KEPT
QUIET, ALTHOUGH NOW THERE ARE SIGNS OF OPEN
ALARM. BUT THEY WILL GET A VICARIOUS SENSE OF
SATISFACTION OUT OF THE FAILURE OF THE DEPOSED
MR GIEREK'S WESTERN-FUELLED ECONOMIC
PROGRAMME. THEY MAY VIEW THE NEAR-COLLAPSE OF
THIS "DEVIATIONIST", FAR TOO AMBITIOUS AND BADLY
MANAGED PLAN AS AN AUGURY OF GREATER
DEPENDENCE ON COMECON, THE SOVIET BLOC'S
ECONOMIC CO-OPERATIVE, AND THUS ON THE SOVIET
POLITICAL MODEL.
THE WEST, WHICH IS BEING ASKED TO PROVIDE
SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS TO KEEP THE POLISH
ECONOMY AFLOAT AND SERVICE ITS MASSIVE EXTERNAL
DEBTS, WILL HAVE TO CO-OPERATE IF SOLIDARITY'S
CAUSE IS TO BE HELPED. INDEED, IT IS THE ONE
THING THE WEST CAN DO. NO ONE IN THE
INDEPENDENT UNION LEADERSHIP SERIOUSLY
ADVOCATES A POLAND OUTSIDE THE SOVIET ORBIT.
SOLIDARITY STANDS FOR QUALIFIED FREEDOM WITHIN
THE GEO-POLITICAL REALITIES. SOLIDARITY IS ABOUT
REFORM: OF SOCIALISM, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE
ECONOMY - IN A ONCE-SUCCESSFUL AGRICULTURAL
NATION WHERE PEOPLE NOW QUEUE FOR BREAD AND
POTATOES. THESE QUEUES SYMBOLISE THE REASON,
IN THE FIRST PLACE, FOR THE "WORKERS' REVOLT". THE
ROOT CAUSE IS ECONOMIC, NOT POLITICAL.
THE SOVIET ARMY WENT INTO HUNGARY,
CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND AFGHANISTAN TO ARREST
POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS. POLAND'S ECONOMY
CANNOT BE RESTORED TO HEALTH THROUGH MILITARY
INTERVENTION AND OCCUPATION. HENCE THE PACT IN
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT EXCHANGED RECOGNITION
OF SOLIDARITY FOR UNION CO-OPERATION IN TACKLING
THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A FINE
DIVISION BETWEEN ECONOMIC REFORM AND POLITICAL
CHANGE. THERE IS NOTHING MORE POLITICAL THAN
AN INDEPENDENT TRADE UNION IN A COMMUNIST
COUNTRY. IT IS HARD TO TELL WHERE EVOLUTION LEAVES
OFF AND REVOLUTION TAKES OVER. WHERE DOES
SOLIDARITY GO FROM HERE WITHOUT TRAMPLING
WILFULLY ON THE HEART OF WHAT THE SOVIET UNION
HOLDS DEAR? POLAND'S PROBLEMS MAY BE JUST
BEGINNING.
<F53>
THURSDAY 27 NOVEMBER 1980
"SOOTHING WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH"
THE THIRD FRASER GOVERNMENT IS IN BUSINESS,
CONVINCED THAT ITS ECONOMIC STRATEGY IS
BASICALLY CORRECT BUT ALSO PERSUADED THAT IT
NEEDS TO EXPLAIN AND PROMOTE ITS POLICIES MORE
EFFECTIVELY. TO THIS EXTENT, AT LEAST, THE ELECTION
RESULT HAS HAD A SALUTARY INFLUENCE. THE
GOVERNMENT ENTERED THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN
SUPREMELY CONFIDENT NOT ONLY THAT IT WAS ON THE
RIGHT COURSE BUT THAT THE ELECTORATE GENERALLY
ENDORSED IT. THE OPINION POLLS, SUGGESTING THE
LIKELIHOOD OF A LABOR VICTORY, SEVERELY SHOOK
THIS ALOOF ASSUMPTION. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT
WAS, AFTER ALL, RETURNED WITH A REDUCED BUT STILL
COMFORTABLE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES, THE DRIFT OF VOTES, ESPECIALLY IN
VICTORIA, SHOWED THAT PARTS OF THE ELECTORATE
WERE FAR FROM SATISFIED WITH ITS PERFORMANCE.
CONTINUED HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, PARTICULARLY
AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE, REDUCED LIVING STANDARDS
AND RISING TAXATION, AND FEARS OF INCREASING
INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES HAVE DIMINISHED
SUPPORT FOR A GOVERNMENT THAT SWEPT INTO
OFFICE IN 1975 WITH THE PROMISE THAT IT WOULD
PUT THINGS RIGHT.
THE TRADITIONAL SPEECH BY THE GOVERNOR-
GENERAL, SIR ZELMAN COWEN, AT THE OPENING
OF PARLIAMENT, SIGNALLED THE GOVERNMENT'S
INTENTION TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO PUBLIC
RELATIONS AND TO SOFTEN THE HARSHER EDGES OF ITS
RHETORIC. THE BASIC THRUST OF ITS ECONOMIC POLICY
WILL NOT CHANGE. THE FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION,
WITH THE COMMITMENT TO CONTAIN PUBLIC
SPENDING AND OPPOSE PRESSURES FOR WAGE RISES,
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE PRIORITY. THE GOVERNMENT'S
FAITH THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN LEAD ECONOMIC
RECOVERY WITHOUT PUBLIC STIMULUS REMAINS
UNSHAKEN. BUT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS AT LAST
RECOGNISED THAT UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOT ONLY
BLIGHTING THE LIVES AND HOPES OF HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF AUSTRALIANS BUT THAT IT IS ERODING
POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES
AND PRIORITIES. THUS THE NEW DEMONSTRATION OF
CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND
THE EMPHASIS ON YOUTH TRAINING SCHEMES AND
JOB CREATION. IT IS A WELCOME CHANGE FROM THE
HOO-HAH ABOUT DOLE BLUDGERS A FEW YEARS AGO.
THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS TO PUT ITS TOUGH
ECONOMIC POLICIES IN A HUMAN CONTEXT, AND TO
APPEAR TO BE DOING MORE TO ALLEVIATE THE PLIGHT
OF THE JOBLESS, ARE ALL VERY WELL. BUT AT THE
NEXT ELECTION THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE JUDGED ON
ITS ACHIEVEMENTS, NOT ITS PUBLIC RELATIONS. THE
REALITY IS THAT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ITS PRESENT
POLICIES UNEMPLOYMENT WILL REMAIN HIGH, AND
PERHAPS RISE AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.
THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO PROVE THAT ITS
POLICIES ARE RIGHT, NOT SIMPLY TO TRY TO PERSUADE
PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE RIGHT. IT IS PROBABLY PINNING
ITS HOPES ON THE VAUNTED RESOURCES BOOM. BUT
UNLESS THE INFLOW OF CAPITAL AND EXPORT EARNINGS
ARE MANAGED WITH THE GREATEST CARE, THE IMPACT
ON THE ECONOMY COULD BE MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN
BENEFICIAL. THE GOVERNMENT HAS YET TO EXPLAIN
HOW IT WILL COPE WITH THE MONETARY
REPERCUSSIONS, THE EFFECT ON AUSTRALIA'S
MANUFACTURING AND RURAL INDUSTRIES, THE
QUESTIONS OF AUSTRALIAN OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL
OF ITS RESOURCES AND THE FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
PROMISED BENEFITS.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS OTHER PROBLEMS ON ITS
AGENDA, TOO. THERE IS THE PRESSING NEED FOR TAX
REFORM, ALREADY CIRCUMSCIBED BY THE REACTION
TO SUGGESTIONS OF A BROADLY BASED CONSUMPTION
TAX AND THE INHIBITIONS ABOUT AN ALL-OUT ATTACK
ON TAX AVOIDANCE. THERE IS THE GROWING PROBLEM
OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, MADE ALL THE MORE SERIOUS
BY THE THREAT TO WAGE INDEXATION AND INDEED TO
THE WHOLE ARBITRATION SYSTEM, AND ALL THE MORE
PIQUANT BY THE CONFRONTATION OF TWO AMBITIOUS
POLITICIANS IN MR PEACOCK AND MR HAWKE. THERE
IS THE CHALLENGE TO THE PUBLIC CONTROL OVER
BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION, AND THE BACKBENCH
REVOLT OVER LEGISLATION FOR A NEW AIRLINES
AGREEMENT. THERE IS THE CONTINUING MUDDLE OF
HEALTH CARE COSTS AND INSURANCE. THE
GOVERNMENT'S LOSS OF CONTROL OVER THE SENATE ON
1 JULY NEXT, WHEN THE INCOMING SENATORS TAKE
THEIR SEATS, WILL MAKE ITS TASK MORE DIFFICULT.
THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH (ESSENTIALLY
WRITTEN FOR HIM BY THE GOVERNMENT) WAS FULL
OF NOBLE SENTIMENTS, HUMANE CONCERN AND GOOD
INTENTIONS, MORE SO THAN MR FRASER'S ELECTION
POLICY SPEECH. BUT THE STRONGER EMPHASIS ON
MARKETING THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES IS UNLIKELY
TO SUCCEED UNLESS THE POLICIES THEMSELVES CAN
BE SHOWN TO WORK, AND ARE SEEN TO BE IN THE
INTERESTS OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, NOT JUST
PRIVILEGED SECTIONS OF IT.
"RUSHING THE NEW TENANCY LAWS"
A LITTLE MORE THAN FOUR YEARS AGO, THE STATE
GOVERNMENT BEGAN AN EXCITING SOCIAL
EXPERIMENT. IT CONVENED A PUBLIC MEETING AND
ASKED THOSE WHO ATTENDED FOR THEIR VIEWS ON
TENANCY LAWS. SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, IT ESTABLISHED
A CITIZENS' COMMITTEE TO ASSES EXISTING LAWS
AND TO PROPOSE CHANGES. IT SEEMED THAT THE
GOVERNMENT WAS MOVING TOWARDS A POLICY OF
SERIOUS COMMUNITY CONSULTATION. AFTER TWO
YEARS, THE COMMITTEE SUBMITTED 168 RECOMMEN-
DATIONS. GIVEN THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE EXISTING
LAWS, THE COMMITTEE TOOK THE TENANTS' SIDE ON
A NUMBER OF BASIC POINTS. IT URGED, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THAT TENANTS BE GIVEN GREATER SECURITY
OF TENURE. BUT IT WAS BY NO MEANS A LANDLORD-
BASHING DOCUMENT. THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF
BOTH LANDLORD AND TENANT WERE SET OUT IN A
PROPOSED CHARTER.
NOW, AFTER A FURTHER TWO YEARS OF DEBATE
AND LOBBYING FROM LANDLORDS, TENANTS' GROUPS,
THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THE BUREAUCRACY, THE
THIRD AND FINAL VERSION OF THE NEW RESIDENTIAL
TENANCIES BILL IS BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT. IN
GENERAL, IT OFFERS TENANTS A MUCH BETTER DEAL.
TENANTS WILL HAVE MUCH GREATER SECURITY OF
TENURE, AND RENT INCREASES WILL BE ALLOWED ONLY
ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS. LANDLORDS WILL NOT BE
ALLOWED TO REFUSE ACCOMMODATION TO PROSPECTIVE
TENANTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHILDREN. WHERE A
DISPUTE EXISTS BETWEEN LANDLORD AND TENANT, AN
INDEPENDENT ARBITRATOR WILL BE AVAILABLE. THE
ATTORNEY-GENERAL, MR. STOREY, SAID YESTERDAY
THAT THE BILL ALSO PROVIDED FOR A NEW PLAIN-
ENGLISH, STANDARD-FORM LEASE AGREEMENT. ALL
THESE CHANGES ARE WELCOME. THEY REPRESENT, TO
A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE, THE BASIC THRUST OF THE
CITIZENS' COMMITTEE'S REPORT IN 1978. BUT THERE
STILL ARE A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT OMISSIONS, AND
THERE IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN AT THE MANNER IN
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS HANDLED THE
LEGISLATION.
MR STOREY SAYS IT IS AN HISTORIC BILL. THAT
IS TRUE. IT IS THE RESULT OF A PROCESS OF COMMUNITY
CONSULTATION NEVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED. TENANTS'
GROUPS CLAIM THAT THE CONSULTATIONS WERE A SHAM,
AND THAT MOST OF THEIR PROPOSALS WERE REJECTED
AFTER PRESSURE WAS APPLIED TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR SUCH
A CLAIM, ALTHOUGH THE GROUPS SHOULD REALISE THAT
CONSULTATION CANNOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT THE
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES TO ACCEPT ALL THOSE VIEWS
PUT TO IT. MR STOREY ADMITS THAT NOT ALL THE
PROPOSALS FROM THE CITIZENS' COMMITTEE HAVE
BEEN ACCEPTED. BUT NEITHER HAVE ALL THE
RECOMMENDATIONS PUT TO HIM BY LANDLORDS. MR
STOREY SAYS THE BILL IS A SATISFACTORY COMPROMISE.
GENERALLY, THAT IS TRUE. THE BILL HAS SOME
SHORTCOMINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE LANDLORDS
CANNOT REFUSE ACCOMMODATION TO TENANTS WITH
CHILDREN, THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BILL TO STOP
THEM FROM DISCRIMINATING ON THE BASIS OF AN
APPLICANT'S SEX, RACE, MARTIAL STATUS OR PHYSICAL
DISABILITIES. BUT OVERALL, IT REPRESENTS A CONSIDER-
ABLE ADVANCE ON THE EXISTING LAWS AND
GUARANTEES TENANTS FAIRER TREATMENT.
WHY, THEN, HAS THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO
RUSH SUCH AN IMPORTANT AND HISTORIC PIECE OF
LEGISLATION THROUGH PARLIAMENT? ON TUESDAY, IT
APPLIED A FIVE-HOUR LIMIT ON DISCUSSION OF THE
BILL IN THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. AS THE LEADER
OF THE NATIONAL PARTY, MR ROSS-EDWARDS, SAID:
"IF THIS IS NOT WORTHY OF A DAY'S DEBATE, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT IS". THE OPPOSITION SPOKESMAN ON
HOUSING, MR CATHIE, SAID YESTERDAY HE HAD
WANTED TO PROPOSE 196 AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL
AND 10 NEW CLAUSES TO CORRECT WHAT THE LABOR
PARTY THOUGHT WERE SHORTCOMINGS. HE DID NOT
GET MUCH OF A CHANCE. MR STOREY SAID YESTERDAY
THE BILL COULD BE DEBATED MORE FULLY IN THE
LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. THAT MIGHT SUIT THE
GOVERNMENT. MR STOREY, THE GOVERNMENT'S MOST
ELOQUENT PROMOTER OF THE BILL, SITS IN THE
COUNCIL. BUT IT SUITS NO ONE ELSE. MR CATHIE IS
IN THE ASSEMBLY. SO ARE THE NATIONAL PARTY'S
LEADERS. THE BILL CONTAINS A NUMBER OF CLAUSES
THAT APPEAR TO FAVOR UNREASONABLY THE LANDLORDS
AND THEIR AGENTS. IT IS A SHAME THAT AFTER FOUR
YEARS OF WORTHWHILE PUBLIC DISCUSSION THE
GOVERNMENT SEES FIT TO HURRY.

FRIDAY 28 NOVEMBER 1980
"FRESH OUTLOOK ON HOUSING"
A NEW BROOM HAS SWEPT THROUGH THE
HOUSING COMMISSION OF VICTORIA, A
BUREAUCRATIC AND TECHNOCRATIC AUTHORITY
NOTORIOUS FOR ITS BULLDOZING OF NEIGHBORHOODS
IN THE NAME OF SLUM RECLAMATION, ITS PRE-
DILECTION FOR DREARY CONCRETE HIGH RISE FLATS,
AND ITS TAINTED INVOLVEMENT IN BROAD-ACRE LAND
DEALS. WITH A CHANGE OF MINISTER AND TOP
MANAGEMENT, THE COMMISSION SEEMS TO HAVE
ACQUIRED A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE AND A HUMAN FACE.
ONE INDICATION IS THE NEW ATTITUDE TOWARDS
COMMISSION TENANTS. THERE IS NOW A MUCH
GREATER WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER AND REMEDY
THEIR PROBLEMS, AND TO INVOLVE THEM IN THE
MANAGEMENT OF ESTATES AND IN FORMULATING
POLICY. ANOTHER IS THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE
REVIEW OF HOUSING POLICIES FOR 42 YEARS, OUTLINED
IN A GREEN PAPER ISSUED BY THE HOUSING
MINISTER, MR DIXON, ON TUESDAY.
THE GREEN PAPER, THE RESULT OF MONTHS OF
CONSULTATION AND CONTEMPLATION, DISCUSSES
FUTURE HOUSING POLICIES AND SETS OUT THOSE
PREFERRED BY THE HOUSING MINISTRY. AFTER
ALLOWING SOME SEVEN MONTHS FOR COMMUNITY
CONSIDERATION, THE MINISTER WILL PREPARE A
WHITE PAPER OF POLICIES EXPECTED TO BE ADOPTED.
AS SOME OF THE PREFERRED OPTIONS ARE ALREADY
BEING TRIED IN PILOT SCHEMES, THEIR WORTH WILL BE
MORE EASILY ASSESSED NEXT YEAR. THE GREEN
PAPER IS NOTEWORTHY FOR DELVING INTO PHILO-
SOPHICAL AS WELL AS PRACTICAL QUESTIONS OF HOW
BEST TO HELP THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD ADEQUATE
SHELTER FOR THEMSELVES OR THEIR FAMILIES, AND FOR
VENTURING INTO AREAS WHICH, ALTHOUGH RELEVANT,
ARE GENERALLY REGARDED AS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF
HOUSING AUTHORITIES.
THE DOCUMENT ASKS, FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER
IT IS BETTER TO PROVIDE THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD
DECENT HOUSING WITH INCOME SUPPORT OR WITH
SUBSIDISED HOUSING. THE CONCEPT OF A GUARANTEED
MINIMUM INCOME, ADVOCATED BY THE HENDERSON
COMMISSION ON POVERTY, FALLS MORE NATURALLY
WITHIN THE RESPONSIBILITY AND RESOURCES OF THE
COMMONWEALTH THAN OF A SINGLE STATE. SO THE
GREEN PAPER OPTS FOR SUBSIDISED HOUSING, WHILE
URGING CANBERRA TO IMPROVE INCOME SUPPORT FOR
THOSE IN NEED. BUT SHOULD THE STATE HELP PEOPLE
OWN THEIR OWN HOMES OR PROVIDE THEM WITH
RENTAL ACCOMMODATION? THE GREEN PAPER'S
SIMPLE ANSWER IS BOTH. YES, LOW-INCOME EARNERS
SHOULD BE HELPED TO ACQUIRE THEIR OWN HOME, IF
THAT IS WHAT THEY WISH, BUT NOT THROUGH THE PAST
POLICY OF SELLING OFF THE COMMISSION'S STOCK OF
HOUSES, A COURSE THAT IN MELBOURNE HAS LEFT IT
WITH MOSTLY HIGH RISE FLATS UNSUITABLE FOR
FAMILIES. THE PREFERRED OPTION, AND IT SEEMS
A SENSIBLE ONE, IS FOR A MORTGAGE INTEREST
SUBSIDY SCHEME RELATED TO INCOME AND FAMILY
SIZE, TAPPING PRIVATE AS WELL AS PUBLIC FUNDS,
AND GIVING THE BENEFICIARIES A WIDER CHOICE.
WHILE HOME OWNERSHIP IS TO BE ENCOURAGED
AS SOCIALLY DESIRABLE AND FINANCIALLY PREFERABLE,
THERE IS STILL A BIG UNSATISFIED NEED FOR SHELTER
AT SUBSIDISED RENTS. SIXTY TO 70 PER CENT OF
PUBLIC HOUSING APPLICANTS NOW ARE SINGLE, MANY
OF THEM UNMARRIED MOTHERS. THE GREEN PAPER
RECOMMENDS THAT THE COMMISSION'S METROPOLITAN
HOUSING BE INCREASED BY 50 PER CENT OVER THE
NEXT FIVE YEARS, NOT BY MORE HIGH RISE FLATS BUT
BY TOWN HOUSE DEVELOPMENTS AND PURCHASES OF
EXISTING HOUSES IN THE COMMUNITY. IT ALSO
PROPOSES A PROGRAMME, ALREADY UNDER WAY, OF
IMPROVING THE AMENITIES AND SECURITY OF HIGH
RISE ESTATES, AND OF GIVING TENANTS GREATER
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR MANAGEMENT. ANOTHER
PROPOSAL IS FOR CO-OWNERSHIP FOR THOSE WHO,
EVEN WITH SUBSIDISED INTEREST RATES, COULD NOT
BRIDGE THE GAP. ALL IN ALL, THE GREEN PAPER AND
THE NEW SPIRIT THAT PRODUCED IT ARE HEARTENING
AND PRAISEWORTHY. THE KEY PROPOSALS DESERVE
COMMUNITY AND PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT.
"THE CASE FOR FEWER ELECTIONS"
MR FRASER, MR HAYDEN, MR CHIPP AND THE
FEDERAL COUNCIL OF THE LIBERAL PARTY SUPPORT
IT. THE ADVANTAGES IT OFFERS TO GOVERNMENTS AND
VOTERS ARE CONSIDERABLE. YET THOSE WHO ARE
IN POSITIONS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEM
ONLY TO HAVE PLAYED WITH THE IDEA OF FOUR-YEAR
PARLIAMENTARY TERMS. AT PRESENT, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES IS ELECTED FOR THREE YEARS. ITS
ACTUAL TERM IS OFTEN SHORTER. TOGETHER WITH STATE
POLLS, THIS GIVES VOTERS A SURFEIT OF ELECTIONS -
9 OR 10 IN THE 1970S, DEPENDING ON WHICH
STATE THEY LIVED IN. THREE-YEAR TERMS ALSO LEAD
GOVERNMENTS TO CONDUCT THEIR AFFAIRS WITH AN
EYE ON THE NEXT ELECTION. LONG-TERM PLANNING AND
DECISION MAKING OFTEN GIVE WAY TO SHORT-TERM
VOTE CATCHING.
THIS WEEK, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT TOOK
WHAT MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS
AN EXTENDED TERM. MR FRASER PROPOSED THAT A
GOVERNMENT BACKBENCH COMMITTEE BE ESTABLISHED
TO CONSIDER THE MERITS OF FOUR-YEAR TERMS. WE
SHOULD NOT EXPECT TOO MUCH. FOR FOUR-YEAR TERMS
TO BE WRITTEN INTO THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, THE
IDEA WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROVED AT A REFERENDUM.
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, THE SUPPORT OF ALL PARTIES
WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE NEEDED. IT IS THEREFORE
A PITY THAT THE NEW COMMITTEE DOES NOT INCLUDE
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DEMOCRAT AND LABOR
PARTIES. WITH ONLY THE GOVERNMENT REPRESENTED,
THE COMMITTEE'S FINDINGS ARE LIKELY TO LACK THE
STATUS AND BROAD APPEAL OF A REPORT IN WHICH
ALL PARTIES HAVE A SAY. NONETHELESS, THE MOVE IS
WELCOME. PERHAPS AN ALL-PARTY INQUIRY CAN BE
HELD LATER.
IT IS NOT A SIMPLE ISSUE. GIVEN THE
OPPORTUNITY TO GOVERN FOR FOUR YEARS OR THREE,
IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT ANY GOVERNMENT
WOULD TAKE THE FORMER. BUT THERE ARE OTHER
CONSIDERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE TERM OF THE
FEDERAL LOWER HOUSE IS EXTENDED, IT SHOULD
IDEALLY BE FOR A FIXED TERM. IT IS OF LITTLE USE
EXTENDING THE MAXIMUM TERM IF GOVERNMENTS
RETAIN THE RIGHT TO CALL AN ELECTION WHENEVER IT
IS IN THEIR INTERESTS TO DO SO. THIS RIGHT GIVES
A GOVERNMENT AN UNFAIR ELECTORAL ADVANTAGE. A
MUCH BETTER ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE A FIXED
FOUR-YEAR TERM, WITH EARLY ELECTIONS PERMITTED
ONLY WHEN A GOVERNMENT LOSES THE CONFIDENCE
OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE IT CAN
NO LONGER COMMAND AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY. THIS
CAN HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF BY-ELECTIONS OR
DEFECTIONS.
THERE IS ALSO THE QUESTION OF THE SENATE.
AT PRESENT, SENATORS ARE ELECTED FOR SIX YEARS,
WITH HALF THE SENATE BEING ELECTED EVERY THREE
YEARS. THE HALF-SENATE POLLS USUALLY COINCIDE WITH
THE ELECTIONS FOR THE LOWER HOUSE. BUT WHILE
FOUR-YEAR TERMS FOR THE LOWER HOUSE WOULD BE
ACCEPTABLE, EIGHT-YEAR TERMS FOR SENATORS WOULD
NOT. NO PARLIAMENTARIAN DESERVES THAT SORT OF
TENURE. TRUE, THE PRESENT SIX-YEAR SENATE TERM
HAS HAD SOME ADVANTAGES, NOTABLY BY GIVING
SOME SENATORS THE COURAGE TO STAND OUT AGAINST
THEIR PARTY'S LINE. HOWEVER, FIXED FOUR-YEAR
TERMS, WITH LOWER AND UPPER HOUSE ELECTIONS
COINCIDING, WOULD HAVE BENEFITS THAT WOULD
OUTWEIGH THAT CONSIDERATION.
<F55>
SATURDAY 29 NOVEMBER 1980
"BENEATH THE SUNSHINE"
UP QUEENSLAND WAY, THEY DO NOT CARE MUCH
FOR SOUTHERN SOPHISTICATES. THEY DO NOT CARE
MUCH FOR THE OUTLANDERS' VIEW OF MR BJELKE-
PETERSEN AS A FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER MOUNTED
ON A BLOATED GERRYMANDER. AFTER DECADES OF
DERISION AS QUAINT COUNTRY COUSINS, MANY
QUEENSLANDERS NOW APPARENTLY FEEL THAT NATURE,
GEOLOGY AND MR BJELKE-PETERSEN ARE ON THEIR
SIDE. INDICATIONS ARE THAT TODAY'S ELECTION WILL
SEE MR BJELKE-PETERSEN AND HIS NATIONAL PARTY
MAINTAINING COMMAND OF AUSTRALIA'S BOOM STATE.
THERE WILL BE CRIES OF "FOUL", OF COURSE, AND THEY
WILL BE JUSTIFIED IF RESULTS REFLECT THOSE OF THE
LAST ELECTION WHEN LABOR WON 23 SEATS WITH 43
PER CENT OF PRIMARY VOTES, THE LIBERALS 24 SEATS
WITH 25 PER CENT AND THE NATIONAL PARTY 35 SEATS
WITH 27 PER CENT.
THE QUEENSLAND SYSTEM IS A PERVERSION OF
THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL OF ONE VOTE, ONE VALUE. IT
MAKES LABOR'S CHANCES OF WINNING POWER NEAR
IMPOSSIBLE AND SEVERELY HAMPERS THE LIBERALS IN
THEIR BID TO BE SENIOR COALITION PARTNER. BUT THE
GERRYMANDER ASIDE, BOTH LABOR AND THE LIBERALS
STRUGGLE UNDER SELF-IMPOSED HANDICAPS.
THE LABOR PARTY, WITH WONDROUS INVENTIVE-
NESS, MANAGES TO FIND NEW WAYS TO STAB ITSELF
IN THE BACK; THE LIBERAL PARTY, ATTEMPTING TO
EMERGE FROM MR BJELKE-PETERSEN'S SHADOW,
STANDS BLINKING IN THE SUNSHINE, THE PATHETIC
VICTIM OF ITS OWN ACQUIESCENCE OVER THE YEARS.
(THE LIBERALS HAVE NOT BEEN MUCH HELPED BY THE
PRIME MINISTER, WHO DEMONSTRATES LITTLE FAITH IN
THEIR ELECTORAL CHANCES AND WHO DUMPED A
QUEENSLAND SON, MR ERIC ROBINSON, FROM
CABINET.)
IT SEEMS THAT ONLY AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN
LIBERALS AND LABOR WOULD BREAK MR BJELKE-
PETERSEN'S IRON GRIP - AND SOME LIBERAL
PARLIAMENTARIANS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY REGARD ANY
SUCH ALLIANCE AS SO UNHOLY THAT THEY WOULD DEFECT.
AND MANY QUEENSLANDERS PROBABLY WONDER WHY
THERE SHOULD BE CONCERN ABOUT BJELKE-PETERSEN
RULE. ISN'T THE SUNSHINE STATE THE PACE-SETTER
IN DEVELOPMENT? DON'T THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
TRAVEL NORTH EACH MONTH TO SHARE THE BOOM?
BUT BENEATH THE SUN AND THE IMPRESSIVE
DEVELOPMENT STATISTICS THERE IS MUCH THAT IS
UNSETTLING ABOUT MR BJELKE-PETERSEN'S
QUEENSLAND: THE CONDITION OF CIVIL LIBERTY, AND
ARROGANT AND REPRESSIVE PATERNALISM TOWARDS
ABORIGINES, NOT TO MENTION THE STRANGE PEOPLE
WHO FIND THEMSELVES UNDER MR BJELKE-PETERSEN'S
PATRONAGE. QUEENSLAND HAS THE LOWEST RATE OF
SPENDING ON EDUCATION, HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE,
AND ONE OF THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. IT
LEVIES ONLY 3.7 PER CENT ROYALTIES ON ITS MINERAL
EXPORTS AND IN THE LONG TERM THE MINERS'
"REGENERATION" AREAS MIGHT BE MONUMENTS TO A
PITIFULLY SMALL RETURN.
THE DANGER OF THE CARICATURE OF MR BJELKE-
PETERSEN IS THAT IT DISGUISES THE FACT THAT HE IS A
TOUGH AND CONSUMMATE POPULIST POLITICIAN. IT
ALSO HIDES WHAT SHOULD BE THE ISSUES IN
QUEENSLAND DEVELOPMENT AND IN HIS POLICIES.
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
ONE OF THE MOST TALKED-OF MEMBERS OF
SOCIETY IS "THE AVERAGE PERSON". THIS
INDIVIDUAL FIGURES IN CONVERSATIONS, NEWSPAPER
EDITORIALS AND POLITICAL SPEECHES.
BUT AS SOON AS WE TRY TO IDENTIFY HIM, HE
ELUDES US. WE SAY "HE" TO AVOID THE CUMBERSOME
"HE OR SHE" FORMULA, RECOGNISING THAT A MEMBER
OF EITHER SEX COULD FIT THE DESCRIPTION AND, IN
ANY CASE, NO PERSON IS AN AVERAGE BETWEEN MALE
AND FEMALE. THIS PERSON IS USUALLY THOUGHT OF
IN QUALITATIVE TERMS RATHER THAN QUANTITATIVE
ONES OF VITAL STATISTICS.
SOME POPULATION SURVEYORS AIM TO IDENTIFY
HIM BY QUIZZING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ON THEIR
PREFERENCES IN POLITICS, ART, MUSIC, DRAMA,
READING, RECREATION; THEIR PRIORITIES IN LIFE, WHAT
THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY ON AND REGARD AS
ACCEPTABLE MORAL STANDARDS. ANYONE WHO SHARES
THE MAJORITY OF PREFERENCES, HOLDS THE MOST
COMMON PRIORITIES AND CONFORMS TO THE PREVAILING
STANDARDS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AN AVERAGE
PERSON.
THIS GENERAL HUMAN AVERAGE FORMS THE
BASIS ON WHICH THE MECHANICS OF GOVERNMENT
ARE ORGANISED UNDER THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. IT
IS ASSUMED THAT WHAT THE MAJORITY AGREES UPON
IS RIGHT, AND THAT A GOOD CITIZEN IS ONE WHO
CONFORMS TO THE PRESENT LEVEL OF PUBLIC OPINION.
ONE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH A SYSTEM IS THAT IT
REQUIRES ITS MEMBERS WHO ARE BELOW THE
AVERAGE TO LIVE UP TO IT, AND PENALISES THOSE
WHO FAIL TO DO SO. BUT IT HAS THE DISADVANTAGE
OF TENDING TO FORCE THOSE WHO ARE ABOVE THE
AVERAGE TO LIVE DOWN TO IT - OR SUFFER THE
CONSEQUENCES.
TO LIVE ABOVE THE AVERAGE, AS WELL AS BELOW
IT, CAN THEREFORE BE A COSTLY BUSINESS SOMETIMES.
AT BEST IT CAN BRAND SUCH INDIVIDUALS AS ODDITIES,
IF NOT AS REVOLUTIONARIES; AT WORST IT CAN REMOVE
THEM AS A THREAT TO THE SOCIAL ORDER.
THUS THE JAIL IN ATHENS CONFINED NOT ONLY THE
BASEST MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO
SOCRATES, ONE OF THE NATION'S WISEST THINKERS.
BRITAIN INCARCERATES NOTORIOUS CRIMINALS AT WAR
WITH SOCIETY - BUT ALSO IMPRISONED BERTRAND
RUSSELL FOR CRUSADING FOR PEACE. THE BIRMINGHAM,
ALABAMA, AUTHORITIES JAILED ITS INFAMOUS
GANGSTERS AND ALSO THAT CHAMPION OF HUMAN
RIGHTS, MARTIN LUTHER KING. THE RUSSIANS
COMMIT TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS NOT ONLY THUGS
BUT IDEALISTS LIKE SAKHAROV AND SOLZHENITSYN. AT
CALVARY, THE GOVERNMENT EXECUTED JESUS, "WHO
WENT ABOUT DOING GOOD", BETWEEN TWO THIEVES
WHO WENT ABOUT COMMITTING CRIMES.
SINCE WE ARE TEMPTED TO LIVE DOWN TO THE
LEVEL OF OUR SOCIAL GROUP, A SEARCHING TEST OF
CHARACTER IS ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE LEVEL OF
PUBLIC OPINION. AN AMERICAN PROFESSOR GOES SO
FAR AS TO SAY, "IN ANY REALM WHERE JUDGMENT
CALLS FOR SPIRITUAL FINENESS, ONLY THE MINORITY
WHO ARE ABOVE THE AVERAGE ARE EVER RIGHT".
CHRIST PUT THAT TEST TO HIS FIRST FOLLOWERS
WHEN HE ASKED, "...HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY?" HE EXPECTED THEM TO LIVE
ABOVE THE AVERAGE.
EVERY REFORM IN HUMAN SOCIETY BEGAN IN THE
CONSCIENCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS
DISCONTENTED WITH MEDIOCRITY, RESOLVED AT ALL
COSTS TO LIVE ABOVE IT, AND SOUGHT TO LEAVE THE
WORLD A BETTER PLACE THAN HE FOUND IT.
<F56>
TUESDAY 2 DECEMBER 1980
"WHY SHOULD WE BE SANTA CLAUS?"
IN THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS MOST OF US OF ADULT
YEARS WILL BEGIN TO FEEL A BIT LIKE FATHER
CHRISTMAS. WHAT BETTER TIME, THEN, FOR THE
STATE GOVERNMENT TO LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN TO
REFORM THE COMMONWEALTH'S TAX SHARING
AGREEMENT - WHICH, AS THE STATE TREASURER PUTS
IT, MAKES VICTORIA "THE FATHER CHRISTMAS OF
AUSTRALIA". SINCE THE COMMONWEALTH TOOK
OVER INCOME TAX FROM THE STATES IN 1942, THE
SHARE IT HAS RETURNED TO STATE GOVERNMENTS HAS
VARIED WIDELY FROM STATE TO STATE. VICTORIA HAS
CONSISTENTLY GOT THE LOWEST SHARE. AND  NOW,
AT LAST, THE HAMER GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED IT
HAS HAD ENOUGH, AND IS DEMANDING A NEW DEAL.
THE FIGURES BACK UP ITS CASE IN NO
UNCERTAIN TERMS. IN THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1979-80,
THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT RECEIVED BACK ONLY
$29 OF EVERY $100 THAT VICTORIANS PAID IN INCOME
TAX. NSW FARED ONLY SLIGHTLY BETTER, RECEIVING
$31 OF EVERY $100 PAID. YET THE QUEENSLAND AND
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS GOT BACK $48
FOR EVERY $100 PAID, WESTERN AUSTRALIA GOT $50
AND TASMANIA $67. IN ALL, VICTORIANS ARE BEING
DEPRIVED OF ABOUT $350 MILLION A YEAR IN ORDER TO
SUBSIDISE THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE FOUR SMALLER
STATES. FATHER CHRISTMAS? WE HAVE BEEN
CONSCRIPTED TO PLAY SANTA ALL YEAR ROUND.
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME JUSTICE IN SUCH
A HUGE REDISTRIBUTION OF INCOME IN 1942, WHEN
DEVELOPMENT IN THE SMALLER STATES LAGGED WELL
BEHIND VICTORIA AND NSW. BUT YEARS OF
CODDLING BY CANBERRA AND STATE ROYALTIES FROM
THE VAST MINERAL DEVELOPMENTS OF QUEENSLAND
AND WA HAVE LARGELY WIPED OUT THESE DISPARITIES.
AVERAGE INCOMES TODAY VARY BY NO MORE THAN 10
PER CENT FROM STATE TO STATE. THE MAIN EFFECT OF
THE REDISTRIBUTION NOW IS TO FORCE PEOPLE IN
VICTORIA AND NSW TO PAY MUCH HEAVIER STATE
TAXES THAN THE OTHERS TO RECEIVE SIMILAR SERVICES.
STATE TAXES IN VICTORIA ARE 50 PER CENT HIGHER
THAN IN QUEENSLAND, FOR INSTANCE, SIMPLY TO MAKE
UP FOR THE FAVORED TREATMENT QUEENSLAND
RECEIVES FROM CANBERRA AT OUR EXPENSE.
THE FUTURE OF THE TAX-SHARING AGREEMENT
IS NOW BEING REVIEWED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION, MR JUSTICE
ELSE-MITCHELL, WHO IS EXPECTED TO RECOMMEND
A NEW FORMULA EARLY NEXT YEAR. VICTORIANS OF
ALL POLITICAL VIEWS ARE UNITED IN DEMANDING THAT
IT MUST BE ONE WHICH GIVES US A FAIR DEAL AT
LAST.
"THE PROBLEM OF RIVAL LAWS"
A FEW YEARS AGO AUSTRALIANS WERE APPALLED
WHEN A SOUTH AUSTRALIAN JUDGE CONVICTED
AN ABORIGINE AND SENT HIM BACK TO HIS TRIBE
TO BE RITUALLY PUNISHED BY SPEARING THROUGH THE
THIGH. WHILE THE DECISION WAS CERTAINLY CONTRO-
VERSIAL, IT ALSO REPRESENTED AN ATTEMPT ON THE
JUDGE'S PART TO GRAPPLE WITH THE PROBLEM OF
CONFLICTING OR RIVAL LEGAL STANDARDS. IT IS A
COMPLEX PROBLEM, AND OCCURS IN ALL COMMUNITIES
WHERE ONE RACE OR ONE PEOPLE HAS BEEN
CONQUERED BY ANOTHER. THE JUDGE WAS NOT
SUGGESTING THAT AUSTRALIA SHOULD RESOLVE THIS
PROBLEM BY HAVING TWO LEGAL SYSTEMS SIDE BY
SIDE: ONE FOR WHITES AND ONE FORBLACKS. BUT HE
DID SUGGEST THAT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WHERE
BOTH CIVIL AND TRIBAL LAW HAVE BEEN INFRINGED,
BOTH SHOULD BE INVOKED: ONE TO DO THE SENTENCING,
THE OTHER TO CARRY OUT THE PUNISHMENT.
THE AUSTRALIAN LAW REFORM COMMISSION
HAS RECENTLY BEEN LOOKING AT THIS PROBLEM OF
CONFLICTING LEGAL STANDARDS. IN PARTICULAR, IT HAS
ADDRESSED ITSELF TO TWO AREAS OF DIFFICULTY. ONE
IS THE DISPARITY AT TIMES BETWEEN THE LAW OF THE
LAND AND ABORIGINAL CUSTOMARY LAW. THE OTHER
IS THE PROBLEM WHICH SURFACED RECENTLY AND
VIOLENTLY AT NOONKANBAH, AND WHICH NOW
THREATENS CONSTRUCTION WORK AT THE PROPOSED
ALCOA WORKS AT PORTLAND: ABORIGINAL CLAIMS
TO LAND WHICH THEY SAY IS SACRED AND TO WHICH
THEY SAY THEY HAVE DEEP HISTORICAL AND SPIRITUAL
TIES. ON THE FIRST OF THESE THE COMMISSION'S
DISCUSSION PAPER ARGUES (CONTRARY TO THE SOUTH
AUSTRALIAN JUDGE) THAT AUSTRALIAN LAW SHOULD NOT
RECOGNISE HARSH TRIBAL PUNISHMENTS, AND THAT THE
TRADITIONAL SENTENCES OF KILLING, SPEARING AND
OTHER FORMS OF WOUNDING SHOULD BE OUTLAWED. ON
THE SECOND, IT SUGGESTS THAT GOVERNMENTS, BOTH
STATE AND FEDERAL, SHOULD DO MORE TO PROTECT
ABORIGINAL SACRED SITES. SPECIFICALLY, WHAT THE
COMMISSION SUGGESTS IS THAT TRESPASSING ON OR
DESECRATING SACRED SITES AND OBJECTS SHOULD BE
MADE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE.
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT THESE DAYS
THE MAIN OFFENDERS TEND TO BE NOT INDIVIDUALS SO
MUCH AS MINING OR EXPLORATION COMPANIES WHICH
CLAIM "NATIONAL INTEREST" AS THEIR JUSTIFICATION.
THE COMMISSION SUGGESTS THAT SOME OF THE
DIFFICULTIES COULD BE OVERCOME BY GETTING
GOVERNMENTS TO DRAW UP A NATIONAL LIST OF SACRED
SITES. WHILE THE COMMISSION'S GENERALLY
PROTECTIVE INTEREST IS HEARTENING, THE FACT REMAINS
THAT MOST ABORIGINAL SACRED SITES ARE BY
DEFINITION SECRET, AND REQUIRING ABORIGINES TO
REVEAL THEM, EVEN ON A STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BASIS,
COULD BE POTENTIALLY DAMAGING TO THEIR WHOLE
BELIEF SYSTEM.
A BETTER SOLUTION TO THE SACRED SITES PROBLEM
IS POSSIBLY THE ONE IMPLEMENTED RECENTLY IN
SOUTH AUSTRALIA IN RESPECT OF 93,000 SQUARE
KILOMETRES OF PITJANTJATJARA LAND. INSTEAD OF THE
ABORIGINES BEING REQUIRED TO REVEAL THEIR SACRED
SITES TO MINERS, WHO THEN DRAW UP WORK PLANS,
THE MINERS SUBMIT THEIR PLANS FIRST; AND THESE ARE
THEN VETTED BY THE ABORIGINES FOR THEIR EFFECT ON
SENSITIVE AREAS. AT NO TIME ARE THE ABORIGINES
REQUIRED TO REVEAL THEIR SACRED SITES. IN THE EVENT
OF A STALEMATE, THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN LEGISLATION
ALLOWS FOR AN INDEPENDENT ARBITRATOR - A JUDGE
 - WHOSE TERMS OF REFERENCE ARE OVERWHELMINGLY
CONCENTRATED ON THE RIGHTS OF THE PITJANTJATJARA
PEOPLE AND THE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION OF
THEIR WAY OF LIFE. THE CRITERION OF "STATE OR
NATIONAL INTEREST" IS LAST ON THE LIST. IT IS AN
ENLIGHTENED PIECE OF LEGISLATION, AND COULD
USEFULLY SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER MINING
COMPANIES AND OTHER TRIBAL GROUPS.
<F57>
WEDNESDAY 3 DECEMBER 1980
"A SURFEIT OF SECRETS"
IT IS DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF
THE JUDGMENT BROUGHT DOWN IN THE HIGH
COURT THIS WEEK BY MR JUSTICE MASON IN THE
DEFENCE AND FOREIGN POLICY DOCUMENTS CASE
INVOLVING 'THE AGE' AND THE 'SYDNEY MORNING
HERALD'.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS COUNTRY, A COURT
HAS SET OUT TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN TWO
CONFLICTING CLAIMS TO REPRESENT THE PUBLIC
INTEREST: THE CLAIM OF GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR
PUBLIC SERVANTS THAT THEY HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT
TO KEEP MATERIAL SECRET IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST
(AS DEFINED BY THEM), AND THE CLAIM OF THE PRESS,
PUBLISHERS AND OTHERS THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT
TO KNOW WHAT GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN UP TO IN
ITS NAME AND AT ITS EXPENSE. MR JUSTICE MASON
HAS DENIED EITHER SIDE A TOTAL VICTORY - THE
CASE MAY BE TAKEN THROUGH OTHER COURTS BEFORE
IT IS FINALLY RESOLVED - BUT IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT
HE HAS LAID DOWN GENERAL PRINCIPLES THAT MAY
SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF PUBLIC
INFORMATION.
OFFICIAL SECRECY HAS LONG BEEN A DEBASED
CURRENCY IN AUSTRALIA. BUREAUCRATS APPEAR TO
STAMP SECURITY CLASSIFICATIONS ON PIECES OF PAPER
WITH THE SAME ABANDON WITH WHICH THE MINTS
OF BANANA REPUBLICS CHURN OUT WORTHLESS
BANKNOTES. INSOFAR AS THERE ARE FORMAL CRITERIA
FOR CLASSIFICATION, THOSE CRITERIA ARE THEMSELVES
KEPT SECRET. THERE IS CERTAINLY NO ORDERLY SYSTEM
WHEREBY INFORMATION IS REGULARLY EXAMINED FOR
RECLASSIFICATION OR DECLASSIFICATION DURING THE
FIRST THIRTY YEARS OF ITS LIFE: OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS
LIVE BY THE ASTONISHING PROPOSITION THAT A
DOCUMENT IS AS SENSITIVE FIVE OR 25 YEARS LATER
AS IT WAS ON THE DAY IT WAS WRITTEN. FOR
EXAMPLE, NONE OF THE PAPERS REPRODUCED IN THE
BOOK 'DOCUMENTS ON AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE AND
FOREIGN POLICY, 1968-1975' WAS LESS THAN FIVE
YEARS OUT OF DATE, YET THE JUDGE SAID HE HAD THE
IMPRESSION THAT, WITH ONE EXCEPTION, THEY HAD
NOT BEEN RECONSIDERED FOR CLASSIFICATION SINCE
THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE.
NO NEWSPAPER OR CITIZEN SHOULD ACCEPT THE
PROPOSITION THAT POLITICIANS AND PUBLIC SERVANTS
CAN BE TRUSTED NOT TO ABUSE THE SECRECY STAMP.
MUCH OF THE MATERIAL LEAKED TO THE PRESS OVER
THE YEARS HAS SHOWN THAT GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR
SERVANTS FREQUENTLY CONFUSE THE NATIONAL INTEREST
WITH THEIR OWN, THAT THEY ARE ONLY TOO READY TO
HIDE THEIR MISTAKES UNDER THE CLOAK OF OFFICIAL
SECRECY AND THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO WITHHOLD
INFORMATION NOT BECAUSE ITS RELEASE COULD DO
THIS COUNTRY HARM BUT BECAUSE IT MIGHT CAUSE
THEM SOME INCONVENIENCE OR MINOR EMBARRASS-
MENT. IT IS BAD ENOUGH THAT SECRECY HAS BECOME
A DEFENSIVE OBSESSION IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE; IT
IS WORSE THAT IT HAS BECOME A HABIT.
'THE AGE' DOES NOT CONTEND THAT
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD HAVE NO SECRETS; SIMPLY
THAT THEY HAVE FAR TOO MANY. WE ACCEPT THAT
THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS, NOTABLY RELATING TO
NATIONAL SECURITY AND PERSONAL PRIVACY, THAT
REQUIRE THE PROTECTION OF SECRECY. ALL THE
PRINCIPAL AUSTRALIAN NEWSPAPERS, ALONG WITH
TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS, ARE VOLUNTARY
PARTIES TO THE "D" NOTICE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH
WE AGREE NOT TO PUBLISH MATERIAL RELATING TO
SPECIFIED AREAS OF NATIONAL SECURITY. SUCH
EXCEPTIONS ASIDE, HOWEVER, OUR BUSINESS IS TO
FIND OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING, OR HAS HAPPENED,
AND TO PUBLISH IT. OUR CONTENTION IS THAT PUBLIC
KNOWLEDGE IS ALMOST ALWAYS PREFERABLE TO PUBLIC
IGNORANCE, AND THAT INFORMATION SHOULD BE
RELEASED UNLESS THERE IS SOME OVERRIDING REASON
WHY IT SHOULD BE KEPT SECRET. GOVERNMENTS TEND
TO TAKE PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE VIEW: THAT
MATERIAL (WHETHER CLASSIFIED OR NOT) SHOULD
REMAIN SECRET UNLESS THEY ARE PERSUADED THERE
IS SOME GOOD REASON FOR, OR POLITICAL ADVANTAGE
IN, PUBLISHING IT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS VIEW
PREVAILS, DEMOCRATIC DEBATE IN THIS COUNTRY IS
STIFLED.
IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT MR JUSTICE MASON'S
JUDGMENT IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE, NOT JUST TO
THE PRESS BUT TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE. FOR
WHILE 'THE AGE' AND THE 'SYDNEY MORNING HERALD'
DID NOT WIN EVERY POINT - INDEED, THEY LOST A
MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE ON THE QUESTION OF
COPYRIGHT - THE JUDGMENT HAS SUPPORTED A
PRINCIPLE FOR WHICH NEWSPAPERS HAVE ALWAYS
FOUGHT. THAT PRINCIPLE IS THAT THERE IS A PUBLIC
RIGHT TO KNOW THAT CAN OVERRIDE THE CLAIM OF
GOVERNMENTS TO PRESERVE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF
ITS INFORMATION. "IT IS UNACCEPTABLE IN OUR
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY", HIS HONOR SAID, "THAT THERE
SHOULD BE A RESTRAINT ON THE PUBLICATION OF
INFORMATION RELATING TO GOVERNMENT WHEN THE
ONLY VICE OF THAT INFORMATION IS THAT IT ENABLES
THE PUBLIC TO DISCUSS, REVIEW AND CRITICISE
GOVERNMENT ACTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COURT WILL
DETERMINE THE GOVERNMENT'S CLAIM TO CONFIDEN-
TIALITY BY REFERENCE TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST. UNLESS
DISCLOSURE IS LIKELY TO INJURE THE PUBLIC INTEREST,
IT WILL NOT BE PROTECTED."
YET IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO IMAGINE THAT
THE JUDGMENT GIVES THE PRESS FREE REIN TO PUBLISH
ANY GOVERNMENT INFORMATION THAT COMES ITS
WAY. LEAVING ASIDE THE COPYRIGHT ISSUE, TO WHICH
WE WILL RETURN, THE JUDGMENT LAYS DOWN RATHER
VAGUE GUIDELINES BY WHICH THE BALANCE OF PUBLIC
INTEREST IN FAVOR OF DISCLOSURE OR SUPPRESSION
SHOULD BE DECIDED. MR JUSTICE MASON SAYS THAT
IF DISCLOSURE "WILL BE INIMICAL TO THE PUBLIC
INTEREST BECAUSE NATIONAL SECURITY, RELATIONS
WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES OR THE ORDINARY BUSINESS
OF GOVERNMENT WILL BE PREJUDICED, DISCLOSURE
WILL BE RESTRAINED". IN SHORT, BOTH SIDES -
GOVERNMENTS AND PUBLISHERS - ARE NOW IN
TRICKY TERRITORY. THEY MUST MAKE NECESSARILY
SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AS TO WHERE PUBLIC INTEREST
LIES - JUDGMENTS WHICH MAY EVENTUALLY HAVE TO
BE WEIGHED, ON AN EQUALLY SUBJECTIVE BASIS, BY
THE COURTS.
ON THE CREDIT SIDE, THIS MEANS THAT
GOVERNMENTS WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO ASSUME
THAT THEY WILL BE GRANTED AN INJUNCTION TO STOP
THE PRESSES SIMPLY BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS
STAMPED "TOP SECRET" ON A PIECE OF PAPER. ON
THE OTHER HAND, NEWSPAPERS AND OTHER PUBLISHERS
KNOW THAT THEY MAY HAVE TO GO TO COURT TO
ADVANCE ARGUMENTS OF PUBLIC INTEREST IF THEY
PRINT INFORMATION BASED ON CONFIDENTIAL
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS. AS MR JUSTICE MASON
SAYS, WITH MASTERLY UNDERSTATEMENT: "THERE WILL
BE CASES IN WHICH CONFLICTING CONSIDERATIONS WILL
BE FINELY BALANCED, WHERE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DECIDE
WHETHER THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST IN KNOWING AND IN
EXPRESSING ITS OPINION OUTWEIGHS THE NEED TO
PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY".
QUITE SO. ON BALANCE, HOWEVER, THE PRESS AND
THE PUBLIC HAVE WON A CONSIDERABLE VICTORY OF
PRINCIPLE ON THE QUESTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY -
ALBEIT A PROVISIONAL ONE IN THIS CASE PENDING A
POSSIBLE FULL TRIAL. BUT THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW
HAS SUFFERED A SETBACK ON THE ISSUE OF COPYRIGHT.
WHILE MR JUSTICE MASON AGREED TO REMOVE HIS
INJUNCTION FROM THE FIRST ARTICLE WE HAD
PROPOSED TO PUBLISH (IT WAS PRINTED IN YESTERDAY'S
PAPER), HE HAS MAINTAINED A RESTRAINING ORDER ON
TWO FURTHER ARTICLES ON THE GROUNDS THAT, IN THE
FORM WE HAD INTENDED TO PUBLISH THEM, THEY
MIGHT HAVE BREACHED GOVERNMENT COPYRIGHT.
THE GOVERNMENT IS, OF COURSE, ENTITLED TO
RESORT TO ANY LEGAL DEVICE THAT IS OPEN TO IT TO
ACHIEVE ITS ENDS. YET IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIZARRE THAT
IT SHOULD FALL BACK ON THE LAW OF COPYRIGHT
IN ORDER TO WIN A LIMITED TECHNICAL VICTORY WHEN
THE ISSUES AT STAKE, ACCORDING TO AT LEAST TWO
MINISTERS, WERE CRITICAL TO THE NATIONAL INTEREST.
THE EFFECT OF THE JUDGMENT WILL BE THAT PUBLISHERS
WILL IN FUTURE RISK COURT INTERVENTION IF THEY
PUBLISH WITHOUT AUTHORITY ANY GOVERNMENT
DOCUMENT, OR SIZABLE EXTRACT FROM IT, HOWEVER
INNOCUOUS THE CONTENTS OF THAT DOCUMENT MIGHT
BE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, COPYRIGHT PROTECTS THE
FORM OF WORDS IN A DOCUMENT, NOT THE INFORMATION
IT CONTAINS. AS MR JUSTICE MASON PUT IT:
"COPYRIGHT IS INFRINGED BY COPYING OR
REPRODUCING THE DOCUMENT; IT IS NOT INFRINGED
BY PUBLISHING INFORMATION OR IDEAS CONTAINED
IN THE DOCUMENT SO LONG AS THE PUBLICATION DOES
NOT REPRODUCE THE FORM OF THE LITERARY WORK".
AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, THIS MEANS A NEWSPAPER
WILL STILL BE ABLE TO REPORT AND COMMENT ON THE
CONTENTS OF A DOCUMENT AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT
PRINT LARGE EXTRACTS FROM IT. EVEN ALLOWING FOR
THE OFTEN INDIGESTIBLE NATURE OF OFFICIAL PROSE,
THIS PART OF THE JUDGMENT OBVIOUSLY REPRESENTS
AN UNWELCOME RESTRICTION ON THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT
TO LEARN HOW IT IS GOVERNED. IT WILL PROVE A
SERIOUS INHIBITION TO BOOK PUBLISHERS, HISTORIANS
AND OTHER ACADEMICS. THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT
ASK ITSELF IF IT IS PREFERABLE TO HAVE CITIZENS
READING SOMEONE'S INTERPRETATION OF AN OFFICIAL
DOCUMENT, INCLUDING A FEW SELECTED QUOTATIONS,
THAN TO ALLOW THEM TO READ THE FULL TEXT AND
MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS ABOUT IT.
THERE IS A THIRD, AND CRUCIAL, QUESTION
RAISED BY THE GOVERNMENT'S LEGAL ACTION THAT HAS
BEEN LEFT LARGELY UNRESOLVED BY THE MASON
JUDGMENT. IN ITS STATEMENTS OF CLAIM AGAINST THE
TWO NEWSPAPERS AND THE BOOK'S PUBLISHERS, THE
GOVERNMENT ALLEGED NOT ONLY BREACHES OF
CONFIDENTIALITY AND COPYRIGHT BUT ALSO POSSIBLE
OFFENCES UNDER SECTION 79 OF THE COMMONWEALTH
CRIMES ACT. THE JUDGE HAD LITTLE TO SAY ON THIS
QUESTION, ON THE GROUND THAT IT WOULD BE
INAPPROPRIATE TO GRANT THE CIVIL REMEDY OF AN
INJUNCTION IN ORDER TO RESTRAIN AN ACTUAL OR
THREATENED BREACH OF THE CRIMINAL LAW.
IT IS OUR VIEW THAT A GOOD DEAL OF THE CRIMES
ACT IS ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE TO A DEMOCRACY IN
ANY PEACETIME CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS BLUNDERBUSS
LEGISLATION, A THING OF CATCH-ALL CLAUSES AND
DRACONIAN PENALTIES. THE SOONER IT IS
SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED TO ACCORD WITH PROPER
STANDARDS OF CIVIL LIBERTY THE BETTER.
THE DANGER IS THAT CANBERRA WILL REACT TO
THE MASON JUDGMENT AND RECENT LEAKS OF
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS BY MOVING IN THE
OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THIS WOULD BE A TRAGEDY, AND
PROBABLY COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE AS WELL. IF THE
PRESENT LAWS ARE NOT HARSH ENOUGH TO PREVENT
GOVERNMENT PAPER FROM FALLING OFF LORRIES ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY, THERE IS NO GOOD REASON TO
IMAGINE THAT EVEN HARSHER ONES WOULD BE. IT
WOULD BE AT ONCE MORE SENSIBLE, AND MORE IN
KEEPING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL, FOR THE
GOVERNMENT TO AMEND ITS THOROUGHLY
UNSATISFACTORY FREEDOM OF INFORMATION BILL ALONG
THE LINES PROPOSED BY A SENATE COMMITTEE AND
HAVE IT PASSED INTO LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, IT
SHOULD INSIST THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICE INTRODUCE
A COHERENT SYSTEM FOR THE REGULAR REVIEW OF
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE
PASSAGE OF TIME. IT IS IN THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN
INTERESTS TO ENSURE THAT ITS SECURITY EFFORTS ARE
DEVOTED TO THE PROTECTION OF SECRETS THAT ARE
WORTH KEEPING INSTEAD OF THE SUPPRESSION OF
INFORMATION THAT THE PUBLIC IS ENTITLED TO KNOW.

FRIDAY 5 DECEMBER 1980
"MR FRASER AND THE LEAKS"
IN THE PRESENT CON-
TROVERSY OVER
OFFICIAL SECRECY, IT IS
WORTH REMEMBERING
THAT JOURNALISTS ARE NOT
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO
PUBLICISE CONFIDENTIAL GOVERNMENT INFORMATION.
POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN AT IT FOR YEARS.
BOTH THE LIBERAL-NCP COALITION AND THE
LABOR PARTY HAVE USED LEAKED MATERIAL, FOR
POLITICAL ADVANTAGE, WHEN IN OPPOSITION. FOR
EXAMPLE, TREASURY INFORMATION WHICH REACHED
THE NON-LABOR OPPOSITION WAS VERY MUCH PART
OF THE LOANS AFFAIR WHICH PLAYED SUCH A CRITICAL
ROLE IN THE DOWNFALL OF THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT.
OVER THE YEARS, MANY OF THE GOVERNMENT
DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE COME INTO THE HANDS OF
NEWSPAPERS HAVE BEEN LEAKED TO THEM NOT BY
PUBLIC SERVANTS BUT BY POLITICIANS.
IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT IN HIS DAYS AS
OPPOSITION LEADER THE PRESENT PRIME MINISTER,
MR FRASER, ADOPTED A RATHER MORE EQUIVOCAL
VIEW TOWARDS BREACHES OF OFFICIAL SECRECY THAN
HE SEEMS TO TAKE TODAY. HE HAD SOME MOST
INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY ON THE TOPIC ON 5 JULY
1975 DURING AN INTERVIEW ON THE ABC 'FOUR
CORNERS' PROGRAMME. AS A HELPFUL CONTRIBUTION
TO THE PRESENT DEBATE, IT SEEMS A GOOD IDEA TO
REPRODUCE THE RELEVANT SECTION OF THE TRANSCRIPT:
QUESTION: DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A
REPREHENSIBLE THING IF TREASURY OFFICIALS WERE
LEAKING MATERIAL TO YOU?
MR FRASER: I THINK IT WOULD BE WRONG, YES.
QUESTION: WOULD YOU ACCEPT IT IF YOU WERE
GIVEN THAT SORT OF INFORMATION?
MR FRASER: WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN IT.
THERE COULD BE CIRCUMSTANCES, I BELIEVE, IN
WHICH A TREASURY OFFICIAL COULD REGARD AS (SIC)
OVERRIDING DUTY TO AUSTRALIA AS BEING GREATER
THAN HIS DUTY TO A GOVERNMENT. AND ULTIMATELY
OUR DUTY LIES TO AUSTRALIA FIRST.
QUESTION: THAT'S A FAIRLY CONTROVERSIAL
STATEMENT ISN'T IT?
MR FRASER: WELL IT MIGHT BE.
QUESTION: YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THERE ARE
OCCASIONS WHEN PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULD NOT BE
PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE TO THEIR MINISTERS BUT TO
PERHAPS THE OPPOSITION?
MR FRASER: NO, NOT TO THE OPPOSITION, TO
AUSTRALIA. CERTAINLY NOT THE OPPOSITION. BUT YOU
KNOW IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A MAJOR MATTER OF
CONSCIENCE.
IN SHORT, MR FRASER'S POSITION IN THOSE DAYS
SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT WHILE IT WOULD BE
WRONG FOR A PUBLIC SERVANT TO LEAK SECRET
INFORMATION - THEREBY BREACHING CONFIDENTIALITY
AND RISKING PROSECUTION UNDER THE CRIMES ACT -
IT MIGHT ALSO BE JUSTIFIABLE IN THE GREATER
NATIONAL INTEREST. MR JUSTICE MASON COULD HARDLY
HAVE PUT IT BETTER.
"TENNIS HURT BY BIG SHOTS"
THE SUPERB TENNIS SEEN ON THE COURTS AT
KOOYONG AND WHITE CITY IN THE PAST TWO
WEEKS HAS BECOME SLIGHTLY OVERSHADOWED BY A
WRANGLE OVER CLAIMS THAT THE THREE TOP WOMEN
PLAYERS RECEIVED APPEARANCE MONEY TO COMPETE.
AMID THE ALLEGATIONS MADE BY WENDY
TURNBULL, AUSTRALIA'S SECOND-RANKED PLAYER, AND
THE SUBSEQUENT DENIALS OR SILENCE OF THOSE
INVOLVED, IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT EVONNE CAWLEY
AGREED TO PLAY AT KOOYONG LAST WEEK ONLY AFTER
TENNIS OFFICIALS HAD ARRANGED FOR HER TO RECEIVE
A LARGE FEE FROM TOYOTA FOR MAKING BRIEF
TELEVISION COMMERCIALS.
THIS MAY NOT BE AGAINST THE LETTER OF THE
INTERNATIONAL RULE BANNING THE PAYMENT OF
APPEARANCE MONEY, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY AGAINST THE
SPIRIT OF IT AND, UNDERSTANDABLY, OTHER PLAYERS
ARE ANGRY. SPORTS FANS MAY ALSO WONDER WHY,
WHEN A PLAYER OF MRS CAWLEY'S CALIBRE COULD
EXPECT TO EARN $40,000 OR MORE IN PRIZE MONEY
FROM THE THREE MAJOR AUSTRALIAN TOURNAMENTS,
SHE SHOULD REQUIRE FURTHER INDUCEMENT TO PLAY
IN HER HOME COUNTRY.
THE QUESTION SHOULD BE ASKED, PARTICULARLY
AS THE COST OF STAGING TOURNAMENTS HAS HELPED
PUSH THE LTAA INTO SERIOUS FINANCIAL TROUBLE.
THIS YEAR THE LTAA FACES A DEFICIT OF UP TO
$200,000. THE MAIN CAUSE IS REPORTED TO BE THAT
THE PRIZE MONEY RECEIVED BY THE PLAYERS IN THE
MAJOR TOURNAMENTS WILL BE $250,000 MORE THAN
THE MONEY PROVIDED BY TOURNAMENT SPONSORS.
THIS WEEK THE LTAA DECIDED TO TRY TO PAY ITS
WAY OUT OF THE RED BY IMPOSING A LEVY ON THE
250,000 AUSTRALIANS WHO BELONG TO REGISTERED
TENNIS CLUBS. WHILE THE LEVY WILL BE MODEST,
PROBABLY $1 PER PLAYER, IT SEEMS HIGHLY
UNDESIRABLE THAT ORDINARY TENNIS PLAYERS SHOULD
BE TAXED IN ORDER TO FURTHER INFLATE THE HUGE
INCOMES ENJOYED BY THE TOP PLAYERS ON THE WORLD
CIRCUIT.
THE ISSUE OF MRS CAWLEY'S APPEARANCE
MONEY WOULD BE LESS SERIOUS IF IT WAS AN ISOLATED
CASE; UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT. THE ADMIRABLY FAIR
SYSTEM OF REWARDING PLAYERS DEVISED IN THE EARLY
1970S IS BEING BROKEN DOWN GRADUALLY BY THE
TOP PLAYERS' RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF WEALTH - NOT
THROUGH TOURNAMENTS, BUT THROUGH THE EASIER
AVENUES OF EXHIBITIONS, CHALLENGE MATCHES AND
APPEARANCE MONEY. WHEN VITAS GERULAITIS
RETURNS TO MELBOURNE THIS MONTH TO PLAY IN THE
AUSTRALIAN OPEN, SIMILARLY, IT WILL BE ONLY
BECAUSE THE LTAA HAS MET HIS AGENT'S DEMAND
FOR A LARGE FEE BY ARRANGING TV COMMERCIALS FOR
CHANNEL 7.
IT MUST BE CONCEDED THAT AUSTRALIA HAS
UNIQUE PROBLEMS IN ATTRACTING PLAYERS FROM THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD TO OUR TOURNAMENTS. BUT
THE PROBLEM IS NOT AUSTRALIA'S ALONE AND, UNLESS
THE HIGH DEMANDS OF THE SUPERSTARS (OR THEIR
AGENTS) CAN BE CURBED, MANY TOURNAMENTS WILL
BE IN JEOPARDY AND TENNIS ASSOCIATIONS WILL BE
TOO BROKE TO DO THEIR JOB OF DEVELOPING THE GAME
THROUGHOUT THEIR COMMUNITIES.
SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY WRONG WHEN PLAYERS
WHO ARE ALREADY VERY WEALTHY ARE GUIDED MORE BY
THEIR AGENTS - THOSE MONEY MEN ONE SEASONED
OBSERVER TERMS "THE PIRANHA POOL" - THAN BY
LOYALTY TO THOSE WHOSE VOLUNTARY WORK HELPED
THEM TO THE TOP. THE LTAA LEVY SHOULD BE ON
THE SUCCESSFUL PROFESSIONALS, NOT THE BATTLING
AMATEURS. AFTER ALL, WHEN THE PROFESSIONALS PLAY
AT, FOR INSTANCE, KOOYONG THEY RELY ON A SUPPORT
SYSTEM OF OFFICIALS, UMPIRES AND BALL BOYS AND
GIRLS THAT IS LARGELY VOLUNTARY. OR ARE WE ASKING
TOO MUCH OF OUR TENNIS CHAMPIONS?
<F59>
SATURDAY 6 DECEMBER 1980
"BATTLING FOR THE CONSUMERS"
FEW PEOPLE WOULD DENY THAT THE CONSUMER
AFFAIRS BUREAU IS GIVING VICTORIAN TAXPAYERS
GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY. IN RECENT  YEARS IT HAS
EMERGED AS A CHAMPION OF CONSUMER INTERESTS
WITHOUT PREJUDICING ITS CREDIBILITY AS AN
INDEPENDENT MEDIATOR IN DISPUTES.
FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THIS IS SHOWN IN ITS
ANNUAL REPORT TABLED IN PARLIAMENT ON
WEDNESDAY. SIFTING THROUGH THE 15,000
COMPLAINTS RECEIVED LAST YEAR, THE REPORT DRAWS
ATTENTION TO QUESTIONABLE PRACTICES BY FIRMS OR
INDIVIDUALS RANGING FROM HOME RENOVATORS AND
BUILDERS TO DOCTORS, PRIVATE HOSPITALS, CAR
MANUFACTURERS AND RESTAURANTS. IN HIS PARTING
MESSAGE, THE RETIRING DIRECTOR OF CONSUMER
AFFAIRS, MR NORMAN GESCHKE, REITERATES THAT THE
TRANSGRESSORS ALWAYS FORM ONLY A SMALL
PERCENTAGE OF THE TRADERS IN ANY INDUSTRY, THE
VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE RECEPTIVE TO
CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR
CONSUMERS TO HAVE THE EXCEPTIONS PUBLICLY
INDENTIFIED SO THAT THEY CAN STEER CLEAR OF THEM.
PERHAPS THE MOST STRIKING CASES CITED IN
THE REPORT ARE THOSE INVOLVING AUSTRALIA'S
LARGEST CAR MANUFACTURER, GENERAL MOTORS-
HOLDEN'S, AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. MR
GESCHKE ACCUSES GMH OF TRYING TO AVOID
RESPONSIBILITY FOR FAULTS REPORTED BY NUMEROUS
PURCHASERS OF COMMODORES, GEMINIS, SUNBIRDS
AND KINGSWOODS. HE POINTS OUT, FAIRLY, THAT ONE
MUST EXPECT OCCASIONAL DEFECTS IN NEW VEHICLES.
WHAT MR GESCHKE FINDS INEXCUSABLE IS THE
INTRANSIGENT ATTITUDE TAKEN BY THE COMPANY
WHEN CONSUMERS SOUGHT TO HAVE THESE DEFECTS
RECTIFIED. EVEN THE BIGGEST FIRMS SHOULD NOT BE
ABLE TO BRUSH THEIR CUSTOMERS ASIDE.
MR GESCHKE ALSO DEVOTES CONSIDERABLE
ATTENTION TO COMPLAINTS ABOUT VARIOUS RIP-OFFS
BY DOCTORS AND PRIVATE HOSPITALS. IN PARTICULAR,
HE QUESTIONS THE PRACTICE OF DOCTORS REFERRING
PATIENTS TO HOSPITALS THEY OWN THEMSELVES,
LIKENING IT TO ALLOWING JUDGES TO HAVE SHARES IN
JAILS. THIS MAY BE A TRADITIONAL MEDICAL
PRACTICE, BUT MR GESCHKE RIGHTLY POINTS OUT THAT
IT CREATES A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHICH OTHER
PROFESSIONS WOULD NOT ALLOW. HE SUGGESTS THE
STATE GOVERNMENT LEGISLATE TO REQUIRE SUCH
DOCTORS TO DECLARE THEIR PECUNIARY INTEREST
BEFORE ARRANGING FOR PATIENTS TO BE ADMITTED. IT
IS A MODEST PROPOSAL, BUT A SENSIBLE ONE, AND
THE HEALTH MINISTER, MR BORTHWICK, SHOULD BE
QUICK TO ACT ON IT.
IN HIS SIX YEARS AS DIRECTOR, MR GESCHKE,
A BRAVE AND COMMONSENSICAL MAN, MADE HIMSELF
A VERY VISIBLE PUBLIC SERVANT AND HELPED
AWAKEN VICTORIANS TO THEIR RIGHTS AS
CONSUMERS. WHILE THE BUREAU'S WORK IN
HANDLING COMPLAINTS IS INDISPENSABLE,
CONSUMERISM IS ONE AREA IN WHICH PREVENTION
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN CURE. TOO LITTLE
ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO CONSUMER EDUCATION
IN THE PLACES WHERE IT OUGHT TO BEGIN: THE
SCHOOLS. IN 1980 WE ARE STILL ALLOWING
CHILDREN TO EMERGE FROM SCHOOLS INTO ADULT LIFE
WITH LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO COPE WITH THE
FINANCIAL DEALINGS THAT WILL PLAY SUCH A MAJOR
PART IN THEIR LIVES. TO RECTIFY THIS SHOULD BE
THE CHALLENGE AWAITING MR GESCHKE'S SUCCESSOR.
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
"THE WORLD IS OUT OF JOINT. O CURSED SPITE,
THAT I WAS EVER BORN TO SET IT RIGHT." A
REASONABLE ENOUGH REACTION FROM THE SON OF A
KING WITH A STRONG CLAIM TO A THRONE USURPED BY
HIS UNCLE! OUR OWN CASE IS DIFFERENT. THE WORLD
IS OUT OF JOINT ALL RIGHT BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH
THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT,
EITHER AS INDIVIDUALS OR AS A COUNTRY.
IT IS UNLIKELY, AS THE PRIME MINISTER WISELY
REMARKED, THAT THE RUSSIANS WILL WITHDRAW FROM
AFGHANISTAN BECAUSE AUSTRALIA SAYS THAT IT DOES
NOT APPROVE. NOR DOES ANY INDIVIDUAL AUSTRALIAN
HAVE MUCH INFLUENCE UPON WHAT OUR RULERS SAY
OR DO ON OUR BEHALF. WE CAN GET RID OF THEM
EVERY THREE YEARS OR SO BUT THAT IS NOT MUCH,
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE DOES NOT SEEM A GREAT DEAL
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM, OR IF WE LIKE THE
ALTERNATIVE AS LITTLE AS WE DO THE PRESENT.
THIS IS A REACTION OF DESPAIR, EVEN OF
CYNICISM. IT CANNOT BE THE RIGHT ANSWER. IN THE
GRIP OF AN EARTHQUAKE WE CAN DO LITTLE EXCEPT
TRY TO KEEP OUR HEADS; IN THE PATH OF A CYCLONE
WE CAN BATTEN DOWN AND PREPARE OURSELVES.
THESE ARE "ACTS OF GOD" AS THEY SAY, OVER WHICH
WE HAVE NO CONTROL.
THE WORLD DISASTERS WHICH LOOM OVER US
AND THREATEN US MIGHT SEEM LIKE THE OTHERS BUT
THEY ARE DIFFERENT. FOR THESE, MEN AND WOMEN
ARE OR WILL BE RESPONSIBLE. EVEN THE GREAT POWERS
ARE AT THE CENTRE RULED BY INDIVIDUALS, AND
INDIVIDUALS ARE MEN OF LIKE PASSIONS AS OURSELVES
AND CAN BE AMENABLE TO INFLUENCE, HOWEVER
REMOTE THIS MIGHT APPEAR TO BE. IT IS MADNESS
AND SIN SIMPLY TO AWAIT DISASTER AS THOUGH IT
WERE INEVITABLE.
WHEN THE ROMAN WORLD WAS THREATENED
WITH DESTRUCTION BY THE BARBARIAN INVADERS, WHO
WERE OUR ANCESTORS, SOME PUT UP A FIGHT WHILE
OTHERS WITHDREW INTO MONASTERIES AND PRAYED.
IF THEY PRAYED FOR THE RIGHT THINGS IT MAY BE
THAT THEY WERE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE OTHERS.
THEY PRAYED THAT WHAT WAS MOST PRECIOUS TO
THEM, THE CHRISTIAN FAITH, MIGHT SURVIVE EVEN IF
ALL ELSE WAS LOST; AND, BY ONE MEANS OR ANOTHER,
SO IT WAS. THERE IS A PLACE TODAY FOR PRAYER, IF
ONLY BECAUSE IT FORCES US TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT
IS MOST IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE.
BUT PRAYER IS DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT
BELIEVE. IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE? WE ARE FACED,
AS IT SEEMS TO US ON OUR SIDE OF THE FENCE, WITH
THE MENACE OF RUSSIAN IMPERIALISM, WITH A
PECULIAR AND TERRIFYINGLY MANIACAL UPSURGE IN
IRAN OF ISLAMIC IRREDENTISM, AND WITH A COLLAPSE
OF CONFIDENCE AND PURPOSE IN OUR WESTERN
WORLD. ADD TO THOSE AN ANGRY AFRICA AND A
SEETHING SOUTH AMERICA, NOT TO MENTION AN
INCALCULABLE CHINA AND THE POSSIBILITY OF
WIDESPREAD FAMINE AND DISEASE IN ALL THE THIRD
WORLD.
TO AN INDIVIDUAL AUSTRALIAN, CITIZEN OF A RICH
COUNTRY BUT OF A POPULATION OF ONLY 14 MILLION,
THERE SEEMS LITTLE ENOUGH THAT HE CAN DO.
SURELY WE MUST BEGIN AT HOME. MUCH OF THE
WORLD'S TROUBLE IS, AS IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN, THE
RESULT OF GREED. WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DO
MUCH ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S GREED BUT THERE IS NO
NEED TO BE GREEDY OURSELVES. WE MIGHT EVEN
TRY TO BE MORE POSITIVE THAN THAT AND BE
GENEROUS. WE MIGHT TRY TO SET OUR OWN HOUSE IN
ORDER AND CORRECT OUR OWN MORALS. WE MIGHT
TRY TO ASK FOR LESS FOR OURSELVES, EVEN BE PREPARED
TO LOWER OUR OWN STANDARD OF LIVING IN ORDER TO
HELP THOSE WHO ARE IN GREATER NEED THAN
OURSELVES. WE MIGHT TRY TO BUILD A MODEL SOCIETY
IN WHICH INJUSTICE AND EVEN PRIVILEGE ARE
REMOVED, AND IN WHICH MEN AND WOMEN SEEK
SOME BETTER OBJECTIVE THAN MATERIAL POSSESSIONS.
WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DO MUCH BY OUR
STRENGTH; WE MIGHT DO MORE BY OUR EXAMPLE.
<F60>
TUESDAY 9 DECEMBER 1980
"WRONG QUESTIONS, WRONG ANSWERS"
IF YOU START BY ASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS,
YOU WILL USUALLY FINISH WITH THE WRONG
ANSWERS. THE TRAGEDY IN THE IMMINENT CLOSURE
OF FOUR SUBURBAN RAILWAY LINES ANNOUNCED
YESTERDAY BY THE TRANSPORT MINISTER, MR
MACLELLAN, IS THAT THE PROPOSED SURGERY
IS IRREVOCABLE - BUT UNNECESSARY. IT FOLLOWS THE
EXAMINATION OF THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM
BY THE LONIE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY, AN
EXAMINATION WHICH HAS RESULTED IN LITTLE MORE
THAN A SELECTION OF WHICH TRAIN AND TRAM LINES
SHOULD BE ABANDONED. THE LONIE REPORT FAILED
TO DISCUSS OTHER WAYS IN WHICH THE RAILWAY
DEFICIT COULD BE REDUCED. NOW THE GOVERNMENT
HAS FOLLOWED IT DOWN A BLIND ALLEY WHERE
REDUCTIONS IN SERVICES WILL LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN
USAGE, AND VICE VERSA.
TO BE FAIR TO THE GOVERNMENT, ONE MUST
RECOGNISE THAT SOME DRASTIC ACTION WAS LONG
OVERDUE. VICTORIAN TAXPAYERS ARE NOW SUBSIDISING
VICRAIL'S OPERATIONS BY $160 MILLION A YEAR. THEY
ARE ALSO PAYING OUT $125 MILLION A YEAR FOR
RAILWAY CAPITAL WORKS, SO THAT, IN ALL, VICTORIAN
WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS ARE EACH PAYING MORE
THAN $200 A YEAR TO KEEP THE TRAINS GOING,
WHETHER THEY USE THEM OR NOT. IT IS AN
INTOLERABLE SITUATION WHICH CRIPPLES THE
GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO MEET SOCIETY'S NEEDS IN
OTHER AREAS, INCLUDING MANY WHICH HAVE GREATER
SOCIAL VALUE.
IT IS UNFAIR TO BLAME THE STATE OF THE RAIL
SYSTEM SOLELY ON THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENTS OF
THE PAST 25 YEARS. THE SPREAD OF CAR OWNERSHIP
HAS CORRODED USAGE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT ALL OVER
THE WESTERN WORLD. THIS IS ONLY NATURAL, SINCE
CARS ARE FAR MORE FLEXIBLE TO OUR WISHES THAN
PUBLIC TRANSPORT, AND THUS MORE CONVENIENT FOR
MOST TRIPS WE MAKE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE
IN A LOW-DENSITY CITY LIKE MELBOURNE, AND IN A
SPARSELY POPULATED REGION LIKE RURAL VICTORIA.
AS THE RAIL SYSTEM LOSES CUSTOMERS, SO IT LOSES
THE ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THE INVESTMENT AND
MAINTENANCE NEEDED TO MAKE IT AN ATTRACTIVE
ALTERNATIVE.
IN VICTORIA, THE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN
AGGRAVATED BY LACK OF FORESIGHT BY GOVERNMENTS
AND UNIONS. FOR 40 YEARS, LIBERAL, LABOR AND
COUNTRY PARTY GOVERNMENTS ALIKE FAILED TO GIVE
THE RAILWAYS ANY SIGNIFICANT HELP IN MEETING
CAPITAL NEEDS, SO THAT THE WHOLE SYSTEM BECAME
ANTIQUATED AND DILAPIDATED. TRANSPORT UNIONS
REFUSED TO ALLOW ANY REDUCTION IN THE CHRONIC
OVERMANNING, SO LABOR PRODUCTIVITY REMAINED
ABYSMALLY LOW. THE BOLTE GOVERNMENT, BACKED
BY VIRTUALLY EVERYONE (INCLUDING OURSELVES),
MADE WHAT IN RETROSPECT WAS A FOOLISH DECISION
TO BUILD THE UNDERGROUND RAIL LOOP, THUS
STARVING THE REST OF THE SYSTEM OF FUNDS. AND
A SERIES OF IRRESPONSIBLE STRIKES BY THE UNIONS
HAS HELPED DESTROY PASSENGERS' CONFIDENCE IN
THE RELIABILITY OF THE RAILWAYS - SOMETHING THAT
IS VITAL IN A SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM.
THEN CAME THE LONIE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY.
LED BY A BUSINESSMAN AND A ROAD ENGINEER, IT
REDUCED THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS OF VICRAIL AND
THE TRAMWAYS TO A SIMPLE GOAL OF ELIMINATING
THE DEFICIT. MOST PEOPLE RECOGNISE THAT PUBLIC
TRANSPORT IS NOT SIMPLY A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE,
BUT ALSO SERVES SOCIAL GOALS BY PROVIDING
TRANSPORT FOR THE POOR, THE YOUNG AND THE ELDERLY
 - AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE ALLOWED TO RUN AT
A DEFICIT (SO LONG AS THAT DEFICIT IS NOT
OUTRAGEOUS). THE LONIE COMMITTEE REJECTED THIS;
IT AIMED TO WIPE OUT THE DEFICIT ENTIRELY. NOR
DID THE SPECTRE OF FUTURE OIL SHORTAGES WORRY
THEM; THEY WERE CONFIDENT THAT MAN'S INGENUITY
WOULD FIND OTHER FUELS, OR OTHER MEANS OF
ENSURING THAT WE WOULD STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE
CONVENIENCE OF THE PRIVATE CAR.
THE MAIN THRUST OF THE LONIE REPORT WAS
TO PROPOSE THAT MANY TRAINS AND TRAMS BE
REPLACED BY BUSES. CONTRARY TO THE WAY THE
REPORT HAS BEEN PRESENTED BY ITS OPPONENTS,
THE COMMITTEE DID NOT PROPOSE ABOLITION OF PUBLIC
TRANSPORT SERVICES AS SUCH. THEIR ARGUMENT WAS
THAT TRAMS AND (ESPECIALLY) TRAINS ARE FAR MORE
COSTLY TO RUN THAN BUSES, SINCE THEY REQUIRE
MORE LABOR, LAND AND CAPITAL. THEY PROPOSED
THEREFORE THAT BUSES REPLACE PASSENGER TRAINS AND
TRAMS ON ALL COUNTRY LINES, EIGHT SUBURBAN
RAILWAY LINES AND SEVEN TRAM ROUTES. THEY ALSO
PROPOSED THAT FARES BE INCREASED TO COVER THE FULL
COST OF THE SERVICES; A RECOMMENDATION WHICH
WOULD DOUBLE THE COST OF RAIL AND TRAM TRAVEL.
AT MR MACLELLAN'S URGING, THE STATE
GOVERNMENT HAS NOW DECIDED TO IMPLEMENT
SOME OF THE LONIE REPORT'S RECOMMENDATIONS -
BUT SELECTIVELY, IN A WAY THAT SMACKS OF
POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM. THE FOUR SUBURBAN RAIL
LINES TO BE CLOSED ARE THE FOUR THAT RUN THROUGH
SAFE LABOR ELECTORATES. PASSENGER SERVICES ON
THE SEVEN SMALLEST COUNTRY LINES WILL ALSO BE
TERMINATED BUT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY NETWORK
WILL REMAIN OPEN. ALL TRAM SERVICES WILL BE
RETAINED - AND MR MACLELLAN HAS PLEDGED THAT
NEW BUS SERVICES WILL BE OPENED ALONG THE
CLOSED RAILWAY ROUTES, EXCEPT THOSE WHICH
ALREADY HAVE OTHER PUBLIC TRANSPORT.
THERE SHOULD BE NO QUARREL WITH THE
DECISION TO CLOSE THE SEVEN COUNTRY RAIL
SERVICES. THEY ARE ALL MINOR LINES, SOME NEEDED
HUGE CAPITAL SPENDING TO REMAIN OPEN AND THE
PASSENGER DEMAND ON ALL OF THEM COULD BE
ADEQUATELY MET BY BUSES, AT FAR LESS COST TO
THE TAXPAYERS. VICRAIL ITSELF RECOMMENDED THAT
THESE LINES BE CLOSED.
THE PROPOSED CLOSURE OF THE FOUR SUBURBAN
LINES IS ANOTHER MATTER. THE MELBOURNE RAILWAY
NETWORK FORMS THE CORE OF WHAT COULD BECOME
AN EXCELLENT PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM IN A FUTURE
OF UNCERTAIN OIL SUPPLIES. THE WHOLE EMPHASIS OF
URBAN PLANNING IN MELBOURNE IS NOW BEING
DIRECTED AT ATTRACTING PEOPLE BACK TO THE INNER
SUBURBS, AND THE RISING VALUE OF INNER SUBURBAN
LAND IS BOUND TO LEAD TO INCREASED RESIDENTIAL
DENSITIES - AND MORE USAGE OF PUBLIC
TRANSPORT. TO DESTROY A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THIS
NETWORK (AND MR MACLELLAN WANTS TO TEAR UP
THE PORT MELBOURNE AND UPFIELD LINES FOR
FREEWAYS) WOULD BE TO DESTROY AN INVESTMENT
WHICH WE COULD NOT REPLACE IF OIL SHORTAGES
PROVE MORE SERIOUS THAN THE LONIE COMMITTEE
ASSUMED. IN MELBOURNE, PUBLIC TRANSPORT HAS
THE POTENTIAL TO BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE IN
FUTURE. WE SHOULD BE WORKING TO MAKE IT THAT
WAY RATHER THAN BEGINNING TO CLOSE IT DOWN.
THE TRAGEDY IS THAT VICRAIL'S FINANCIAL
DEFICIT COULD BE GREATLY REDUCED WITHOUT
SIGNIFICANTLY PRUNING SERVICES IN MELBOURNE. FOR
FOUR YEARS THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SITTING ON
A REPORT WHICH POINTED OUT HOW THIS COULD BE
DONE: BY CUTTING AWAY THE VAST OVERMANNING IN
THE RAILWAY SYSTEM AND INTRODUCING
MECHANISATION WHEREVER POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE
BETTER SERVICE AT LESS COST. THE MCKINSEY REPORT,
AS IT IS KNOWN, ESTIMATED THAT VICRAIL'S STAFF
COULD BE CUT FROM THE PRESENT 23,000 TO ABOUT
13,000 WITHOUT AFFECTING THE SERVICE PROVIDED
TO TRAVELLERS.
THE LONIE COMMITTEE FAILED IN ITS JOB
BECAUSE IT FAILED TO EXAMINE HOW THE SYSTEM
COULD BE MADE TO WORK LIKE THE BETTER RAILWAY
SERVICES OVERSEAS. WE DO NOT NEED SUBURBAN
GUARDS TO WAVE A FLAG AT STATIONS. WE DO NOT
NEED STATION ASSISTANTS TWIDDLING THEIR THUMBS
AND SELLING OR PUNCHING THE ODD TICKET WHEN
MACHINES CAN DO THE JOB FAR MORE CHEAPLY.
SHUNTERS, CLEANERS, BOOKING CLERKS, STOREMEN,
TRACK GANGS - THE MCKINSEY REPORT FOUND
VICRAIL TO BE GROSSLY OVERMANNED BY
COMPARISON WITH OVERSEAS SYSTEMS, AND FAR
BEHIND IN THE INTRODUCTION OF LABOR-SAVING
TECHNOLOGY.
THE RAILWAYS SHOULD BE ALLOWED A FUTURE.
IF COMMUTERS ARE TO BE FREED FROM THE VICIOUS
CIRCLE OF HUGE DEFICITS LEADING TO FARE RISES AND
CUTBACKS IN SERVICES, IT CAN ONLY BE BY THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE UNIONS AGREEING TO A
"PRODUCTIVITY DEAL", LIKE THOSE INTRODUCED ON THE
WATERFRONT AND IN THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY. THE
UNIONS SHOULD AGREE TO ALLOW THE RAPID
INTRODUCTION OF LABOR-SAVING TECHNOLOGY IN
RETURN FOR GENEROUS RETIREMENT PAYMENTS,
RETRAINING AND PAY RISES, RETENTION OF ALL
SUBURBAN RAIL SERVICES AND AN UNDERTAKING
THAT FOR 10 YEARS THE GOVERNMENT WILL INVEST
THE MONEY SAVED ON WAGES IN CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE VICRAIL SOMETHING TO BE
PROUD OF. WITHOUT SUCH AN AGREEMENT, THE
VICTORIAN RAILWAYS FACE A BLEAK FUTURE.
<F61>
WEDNESDAY 10 DECEMBER 1980
"PRESS FREEDOM: THE COMMON FIGHT"
FREEDOM IS LIKE GOOD HEALTH: WE TEND TO
VALUE IT ONLY WHEN WE NO LONGER HAVE IT.
ON A WARM SUMMER DAY IN MELBOURNE, IT MAY
SEEM HARD TO IMAGINE THAT THINGS WE TAKE FOR
GRANTED - THE FREEDOM TO READ INFORMATION, TO
KNOW THINGS, TO SAY WHAT WE THINK - COULD
EVER BE STRIPPED FROM US. YET SUCH THINGS HAVE
HAPPENED. PEOPLE IN INDIA SIMILARLY TOOK THEIR
FREEDOMS FOR GRANTED UNTIL ONE DAY IN 1975
THEY WOKE TO FIND MRS GANDHI HAD ABOLISHED
THEM UNDER THE GUISE OF A NATIONAL EMERGENCY.
IN THE NEXT 18 MONTHS A FEW NEWSPAPERS AND
MAGAZINES DISPLAYED IMMENSE COURAGE AND
RESOURCEFULNESS IN DEFYING THE DICTATOR IN ORDER
TO KEEP FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ALIVE IN INDIA -
AND NONE MORE SO THAN THE CALCUTTA NEWSPAPER
THE 'STATESMAN', LED BY ITS MANAGING DIRECTOR
MR CUSHROW IRANI - UNTIL MRS GANDHI GAVE WAY
AND RESTORED PRESS FREEDOM IMMEDIATELY BEFORE
THE ELECTION AT WHICH SHE WAS DEFEATED.
YESTERDAY IN MELBOURNE MR IRANI, WHO IS
THE NEW CHAIRMAN OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS
INSTITUTE, WARNED THAT NONE OF US CAN NOW
ASSUME THAT OUR FREEDOM IS INVIOLABLE.
TWO-THIRDS OF THE WORLD'S GOVERNMENTS, HE
POINTED OUT, "HAVE A LESS THAN SKIN DEEP
COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS". THESE
GOVERNMENTS, OF RIGHT AND LEFT, HAVE A COMMON
INTEREST IN PREVENTING THE REPORTING, ANALYSIS AND
CRITICISM OF THEIR ACTIONS IN THE MEDIA AND THE
COMMUNITY AT LARGE. IN RECENT YEARS PRESS
FREEDOM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAS BEEN
SHRINKING RATHER THAN GROWING, AND A CONCERTED
ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE BY DICTATORSHIPS AND
WOULD-BE DICTATORSHIPS THROUGH UNESCO TO
PROVIDE A RESPECTABLE-SOUNDING RATIONALE FOR THE
GLOBAL CENSORSHIP OF INFORMATION.
THE CAUSE OF PRESS FREEDOM IS, OF COURSE,
NOT SIMPLY A MATTER FOR THE PRESS. IT IS NATURALLY
IMPORTANT TO JOURNALISTS AS PRACTITIONERS. IT IS
EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO READERS WHO RELY ON IT TO
GET ACCURATE AND BALANCED INFORMATION ABOUT
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND IN
THE WORLD BEYOND. IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
NEWSPAPERS' FREEDOM TO REPORT INFORMATION IS
THE PUBLIC'S FREEDOM TO KNOW IT. CENSORSHIP OF
THE PRESS IS NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN
CENSORSHIP OF THE PEOPLE.
"THE MELBOURNE WICKET"
THE MELBOURNE CRICKET GROUND, AS WE HAVE
OFTEN BEEN TOLD, IS ONE OF THE FINEST CRICKET
ARENAS IN THE WORLD. ITS FACILITIES, POSITION IN THE
CITY, AND TRADITION, MAKE THE GROUND AN IDEAL
PLACE FROM WHICH TO WATCH ONE OF THE WORLD'S
GREAT GAMES.
BUT TODAY THE FUTURE OF THE GROUND SEEMS
TO BE UNDER SOMETHING OF A CLOUD. AUSTRALIA'S
CAPTAIN, GREG CHAPPELL, IS NOT KNOWN FOR
OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENTS. BUT IN A LETTER TO THE
AUSTRALIAN CRICKET BOARD, CHAPPELL HAS
COMPLAINED ABOUT THE STATE OF THE MCG WICKET
AND SUGGESTED THAT IT NEEDS A BREAK FROM
FIRST-CLASS CRICKET. DESPITE THE TENDENCY OF SOME
ADMINISTRATORS TO DISMISS MODERN PLAYERS AS
"WHINGERS", IT WOULD SEEM THAT CHAPPELL HAS NO
AXE TO GRIND OTHER THAN THE INTERESTS OF THE
PLAYERS AND THE GAME. HE HAS BEEN SUPPORTED,
ALTHOUGH IN A LESS DRAMATIC FASHION, BY THE
INDIAN AND NEW ZEALAND TEAMS.
HIS COMPLAINT IS NOT NEW. A FORMER TEST
CAPTAIN, BOB SIMPSON, IN 'THE AGE' TODAY
EXPRESSES THE SURPRISE HE FELT IN 1977 WHEN,
AFTER 10 YEARS AWAY FROM THE GAME, HE RETURNED
TO FIND AN UNPREDICTABLE MCG PITCH THAT WAS
NOT CONDUCIVE TO GOOD CRICKET.
BECAUSE OF THE PRESENT ROW, PBL MARKETING,
THE PROMOTIONAL ARM OF MODERN CRICKET, SEEMS TO
BE TAKING THE PLAYERS' SIDE AND IS THREATENING TO
MOVE IMPORTANT MATCHES IF THE WICKET IS NOT
IMPROVED. THE VICTORIAN CRICKET ASSOCIATION, A
MORE CONSERVATIVE BODY, SEEMS TO SHARE PBL'S
IMPATIENCE. NEVERTHELESS THE MELBOURNE
CRICKET CLUB HAS SO FAR DONE LITTLE TO COMBAT
THE CRITICISM, AND A MEETING REQUESTED BY THE
VCA FOR YESTERDAY COULD NOT BE ORGANISED.
IT MUST BE RECOGNISED THAT THE MCG CURATOR
FACES ENORMOUS PROBLEMS. BETWEEN THE VICTORIAN
FOOTBALL LEAGUE GRAND FINAL IN SEPTEMBER AND
THE BEGINNING OF FIRST-CLASS CRICKET MATCHES IN
OCTOBER HE MUST TRANSFORM THE MIDDLE OF THE
GROUND FROM A CHEWED-UP MORASS INTO AN
IMPECCABLE BATTING STRIP. BUT WHILE THE MCC
DESERVES SYMPATHY FOR ITS DIFFICULTIES IT MUST ALSO
FACE CRITICISM FOR THE JOB DONE. FORMER PLAYERS
SPEAK IN GLOWING TERMS OF THE MCG WICKET
OF OLD SO WE MUST ASK WHETHER CONDITIONS
HAVE CHANGED OR WHETHER THE JOB COULD BE BETTER
DONE.
PERHAPS THE ENGLISH SYSTEM, WHICH ALLOWS
FOR AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR OF WICKETS, IS WORTH
THINKING ABOUT. IN ANY CASE, IT IS UP TO THE MCC,
THE VCA AND THE AUSTRALIAN CRICKET BOARD TO
MAKE SURE THAT AN ACCEPTABLE WICKET IS DEVELOPED
AND MAINTAINED, EVEN IF FIRST-CLASS FIXTURES AT THE
MCG HAVE TO BE DELAYED UNTIL THE GROUND HAS
FULLY RECOVERED FROM THE RAVAGES OF THE FOOTBALL
SEASON.

"MONKEYING WITH THE MARKET"
QUEENSLAND'S PREMIER, MR JOH BJELKE-
PETERSEN, ONCE AGAIN HAS RESPONDED TO HIS
STATE'S COMPLEX AND PARANOIA-RIDDEN REFLEX
SYSTEM AND LASHED OUT AT THE PERFIDIOUS SOUTHERN
INTERLOPER. AND, AS IS NORMALLY THE CASE WHEN
REFLEXES ARE GIVEN PRIORITY OVER INTELLECT, IT IS
DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THE LATEST ACTION CAN BE
JUSTIFIED BY THE STATED PHILOSOPHY OF HIS
GOVERNMENT.
THIS APPARENT CONTRADICTION ARISES OUT   OF
THAT GOVERNMENT'S DECISION ON TUESDAY TO
THWART ATTEMPTS BY TWO SYDNEY-BASED COMPANIES,
CLYDE INDUSTRIES AND AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL
INDUSTRIES, TO TAKE OVER TWO QUEENSLAND-BASED
GROUPS, EVANS DEAKIN AND WALKERS.
BASED ON THE DUBIOUS LOGIC THAT TAKEOVERS
LAUNCHED FROM THE SOUTH WOULD HURT HIS STATE'S
"ECONOMY AND COMMUNITY", MR BJELKE-PETERSEN
HAS WARNED (OR PROMISED, DEPENDING ON WHERE
YOU LIVE) THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD GO SO FAR
AS TO INVADE THE STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR ITSELF AND
DO BATTLE WITH ITS PURSE.
THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THIS FURTHER
EVIDENCE OF MR BJELKE-PETERSEN'S PALPABLE
ANIMOSITY TOWARDS THE SOUTH WILL BE APPLAUDED
BY HIS CONSTITUENTS, AS IT APPEARS TO REFLECT A
GENUINE RESENTMENT BY QUEENSLANDERS OF ANYONE
LIVING BELOW COOLANGATTA. IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT HIS
ACTION IS NOT WITHOUT PRECEDENT. WHEN TNT WAS
RAIDING ANSETT BACK IN 1971 OUR OWN SIR HENRY
BOLTE, THAT OTHER GREAT CHAMPION OF UNFETTERED
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, REPULSED THE NORTHERNERS BY
LEGISLATING AGAINST THE TAKEOVER DESPITE THE FACT
THAT MANY OF ANSETT'S SHAREHOLDERS LIVED IN NEW
SOUTH WALES.
MR BJELKE-PETERSEN'S LATEST ACTION TOTALLY
CONTRADICTS THE PLATFORM OF CONSERVATISM AND
FREE ENTERPRISE FROM WHICH HE PREACHES AT
ELECTION TIMES. ALTHOUGH HIS GOVERNMENT
YESTERDAY INDICATED THAT IT WOULD NOT BREACH THE
SPIRIT OF ITS OWN CORPORATE AND SECURITIES
LEGISLATION, THE PREMIER'S FLAGRANT MONKEYING
WITH THE MECHANISMS OF THE OPEN MARKET NOT
ONLY THREATENS TO DAMAGE MANY SHAREHOLDERS
(INCLUDING SOME RESIDENT IN QUEENSLAND), BUT
ALSO JEOPARDISES THE CHANCES OF A NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND SECURITIES LEGISLATION AND
COMPROMISES THE COMMISSION WHICH WOULD HELP
ENFORCE THAT LAW.
WHILE SOME OF QUEENSLAND'S GRIEVANCES
ABOUT OTHER STATES MIGHT HAVE FOUNDATION, THIS
ONE DOES NOT. BUSINESS DOES NOT RECOGNISE STATE
BOUNDARIES AND SO MUST BE REGULATED WITH THE
NATIONAL INTEREST IN MIND. MR BJELKE-PETERSEN
SHOULD ABANDON HIS HASTY AND ILL-CONCEIVED
DEFENCE OF PAROCHIAL INTERESTS.
"THE IRREPRESSIBLE JOHN LENNON"
JOHN LENNON HAD A REMARKABLE LIFE. HE
ENTERED POP MUSIC AS A REBELLIOUS WORKING-
CLASS TEENAGER AND ART SCHOOL DROPOUT: EBULLIENT,
SHARP-WITTED, SEXIST, AGGRESSIVE AND TALENTED.
FOR A DECADE HE WAS DE FACTO LEADER OF A BAND
THAT EXPERIENCED THE GREATEST SUCCESS AND MASS
ADULATION SHOW BUSINESS HAS SEEN. FROM
THIS HE EMERGED AS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PREACHER
OF THE COUNTER-CULTURE'S FLOWERY IDEALISM: PEACE,
LOVE, SEXUAL OPENNESS, DRUGS AND MYSTICISM,
DOING YOUR OWN THING. IN ALL THIS HE REFLECTED
HIS TIME - YET WITH SUCH A FOLLOWING THAT HIS
TIME CAME ALSO TO REFLECT HIM.
THESE DAYS WE TEND TO FORGET HOW HE GOT
THERE. THE BEATLES' RISE TO SUCH IMMENSE FAME
WAS NOT JUST A MUSICAL TRIUMPH: IT WAS ONE OF
THE GREAT TRIUMPHS OF COMMERCIAL MARKETING. IN
THEIR HAMBURG DAYS THE BEATLES WERE A BAND OF
UNKEMPT ROCKERS IN LEATHER JACKETS; THEIR MUSIC
WAS LOUD, CRUDE AND DERIVATIVE. BY THE TIME BRIAN
EPSTEIN PRESENTED THEM TO THE BRITISH PUBLIC,
THEY WERE PACKAGED INOFFENSIVELY IN SUITS AND
TIES, WITH NOVEL YET TIDY HAIRSTYLES AND A
SEXUALITY THAT WAS CUTE RATHER THAN THREATENING.
THE ENSUING BEATLEMANIA WAS LARGELY CREATED BY
A MASS PR AND MARKETING OPERATION SINCE
MATCHED ONLY BY SNOOPY.
WE FORGET ALL THAT FOR TWO GOOD REASONS.
FIRST, IF THE PACKAGING WAS PHONY, THE MUSIC
WAS NOT. AT A TIME WHEN POP MUSIC WAS FULL OF
ABYSMAL SCHMALTZ TURNED OUT BY INDUSTRY HACKS,
THE BEATLES' MUSIC WAS GENUINE: RAW, SIMPLE AND
DIRECT, AND QUITE ORIGINAL. THE BEST OF IT HAD
TREMENDOUS ENERGY AND LIFE - AND JOHN
LENNON'S MOST OF ALL. HAVING REACHED THE TOP,
THEY KEPT MOVING ON, RESTLESSLY INVENTIVE,
ACQUIRING PANACHE, CONFIDENCE AND SOPHISTICATION
AS THEY WENT, TO TAKE POP MUSIC INTO TERRITORY
WHERE BEFORE IT HAD BEEN TOO TIMID TO VENTURE.
THEY PRODUCED SUCH A WEALTH OF GOOD SONGS THAT
THEY DOMINATED THEIR PERIOD, AND TURNED POP
MUSIC INTO A WIDESPREAD CREATIVE ART.
THE BEATLES ALSO QUICKLY BROKE OUT OF THEIR
SYNTHETIC PACKAGING, AND LATER TORE IT TO SHREDS.
NONE MORE SO THAN JOHN LENNON. HE WAS CLEVER,
IRREVERENT, A BORN REBEL AND ONE OF THE WITTIEST
PEOPLE POP MUSIC HAS PRODUCED. HE GREW HIS HAIR
LONG, TOOK DRUGS, MOCKED CHRISTIANITY, ROYALTY
AND SOCIAL STANDARDS, TOOK UP MYSTICISM,
PREACHED PEACE AND LOVE, AND COMBINED THE TWO
IN BIZARRE "LOVE-INS" WITH YOKO ONO TO  PROTEST
AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR.
JOHN LENNON WAS NOT THE FIRST TO DO THESE
THINGS. BUT HIS HUGE FOLLOWING AS A POP SUPERSTAR
MADE HIM THE MOST INFLUENTIAL. WITH THE OTHER
BEATLES, HE LED AN IMPRESSIONABLE GENERATION IN
REJECTING TRADITIONAL VALUES AND CREATING A NEW
INDIVIDUALIST ETHOS SUMMED UP BY THE PHRASE
"DOING YOUR OWN THING". THE WAY THE BEATLES
LIVED HELPED CHANGE THE WAY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
LIVED THROUGHOUT WESTERN SOCIETIES - AND
PERHAPS CHANGED THOSE SOCIETIES THEMSELVES MORE
THAN ANY POLITICIAN WAS ABLE TO DO.
MUCH HAS BEEN MADE OF JOHN LENNON THE
THINKER AND IDEALIST. HE WAS REALLY BETTER AS A
MUSICIAN. THE IDEAS EXPRESSED IN HIS LATER SONGS
AND INTERVIEWS WERE OFTEN SO WOOLLY AND TRITE
THAT IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THEY CAME FROM A
MAN WITH SUCH A SHARP MIND. YET IT IS TRAGIC THAT
SOMEONE WHO USED HIS INFLUENCE TO PROMOTE
PEACEFUL VALUES SHOULD HAVE DIED IN SUCH A
SENSELESS MURDER - A MARTYR TO AMERICA'S IDEAL
OF ALLOWING ANYONE TO OWN A PISTOL. AND, FOR
MILLIONS OF US, IT IS TRAGIC THAT JOHN LENNON
IS DEAD.
<F63>
TUESDAY 16 DECEMBER 1980
"THE RETURN OF DR OBOTE"
DR APOLLO MILTON OBOTE HAS BECOME
THE FIRST LEADER OF AN AFRICAN NATION TO WIN
RE-ELECTION AFTER BEING OVERTHROWN IN A COUP.
BUT WAS THE POLL RIGGED? THE DEFEATED PARTIES
SAY IT WAS. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMONWEALTH
TEAM OF OBSERVERS, MR DEBRAH, OF GHANA, SAYS
IT WAS NOT. IT SEEMS THAT THE TRUTH MAY LIE
SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. THE FULL PICTURE OF
UGANDA'S FIRST ELECTION FOR 18 YEARS IS UNLIKELY
TO EMERGE. THERE WERE ONLY 38 COMMONWEALTH
OBSERVERS FOR 5000 POLLING STATIONS. THEIR
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT NOTWITHSTANDING, MANY OF
THE OBSERVERS, INCLUDING AUSTRALIANS, WILL BE
ANXIOUS TO AVOID A WHITEWASH IN THE REPORT TO
BE ISSUED WITHIN A FORTNIGHT.
THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT
DR OBOTE DOES NOT OWE HIS VICTORY SOLELY TO
SKILFUL PARTY ORGANISATION AND HIS OWN QUALITIES
OF LEADERSHIP. HE HAD FRIENDS IN ALL THE RIGHT
PLACES: IN TANZANIA, WHOSE ARMY OF OCCUPATION
IS STILL IN UGANDA AND WHICH PROVIDED AIRCRAFT,
VEHICLES AND MONEY TO SMOOTH THE WAY; AND IN
UGANDA'S  RULING MILITARY COMMISSION, ITS INTERIM
GOVERNMENT, AND THE ARMY AND THE MILITIA, NONE
OF WHICH TOOK AN IMPARTIAL ELECTORAL POSITION.
THERE ARE PERSUASIVE ALLEGATIONS THAT THE
SECURITY FORCES LENT THEIR ACTIVE SUPPORT TO THE
INTIMIDATION OF DR OBOTE'S OPPONENTS, SOME OF
WHOM WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO REGISTER AS
CANDIDATES.
OPENLY PRO-OBOTE RETURNING OFFICERS WERE
PUT IN PLACE AROUND THE CONSTITUENCIES, WHICH
WERE DRAWN UP TO THE GROSS DISADVANTAGE OF THE
THREE MILLION BUGANDA, WHO HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN
THAT DR OBOTE ABOLISHED THE NATION'S KINGDOMS
AND OUSTED THE KABAKA OF BUGANDA FROM THE
PRESIDENCY. A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION,
ANTI-OBOTE FIGURES SUCH AS CHIEF JUSTICE
WAMBUZI AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE APPEAL COURT
WERE SACKED. PERHAPS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
MILITARY COMMISSION SUMMED UP THE SITUATION
MOST ACCURATELY WHEN HE TOLD AN ELECTION RALLY
RECENTLY THAT "THE PROBLEM FOR THE UPC NOW IS
NOT TO WIN THE ELECTION, BECAUSE IT IS ALREADY
WON".
DOUBTS ABOUT DR OBOTE'S METHODS ARE NOT
NEW. HE WAS UNPOPULAR BEFORE AMIN OVERTHREW
HIM IN 1971, AS THE POST-COUP CELEBRATIONS
SHOWED. IT WAS DR OBOTE WHO SUSPENDED THE
1967 ELECTION, REWROTE THE CONSTITUTION, SET UP A
ONE-PARTY, SOCIALIST-ORIENTED STATE, APPOINTED
HIMSELF EXECUTIVE PRESIDENT, AND USED DEVIOUS
MEANS TO RETAIN HIS HOLD ON POWER. HOWEVER,
WHILE MANY UGANDANS DENIGRATE DR OBOTE
PERSONALLY AND CRITICISE HIS PREVIOUS RECORD OF
OFFICE, THEY BELIEVE GRUDGINGLY THAT HE IS
PROBABLY THE ONLY PERSON CAPABLE OF STABILISING
UGANDA. AFTER ALL, THE COUNTRY HAS TO BE REBUILT
FROM SCRATCH AFTER THE HORROR AND DEVASTATION
OF THE AMIN YEARS. UGANDA IS THE KAMPUCHEA
OF AFRICA, WITH A DESPERATE NEED FOR ORDER AND
FOREIGN INVESTMENT. THE FACT THAT DR OBOTE HAS
RETURNED TO POWER IN QUESTIONABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
WILL NOT MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR HIM TO TACKLE
UGANDA'S DIVISIONS AND ITS PROBLEMS OF ANARCHY,
BANKRUPTCY AND STARVATION.
"BUT WHAT IS 'IMMORAL SEX'?"
THE HAMER GOVERNMENT'S ENLIGHTENED SEXUAL
OFFENCES BILL NOW STANDS SPOILED BY A LAST-
MINUTE ADDITION DESIGNED TO PLACATE LIBERAL
PARTY CONSERVATIVES. AN AMENDMENT RUSHED
THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ON THURSDAY
NIGHT CREATES A NEW OFFENCE IN VICTORIA OF
SOLICITING IN A PUBLIC PLACE "FOR IMMORAL SEXUAL
PURPOSES". WHAT ARE THESE IMMORAL PURPOSES?
WE DO NOT KNOW. THE BILL LEAVES IT ENTIRELY A
MATTER FOR SPECULATION.
IN EFFECT, THE NEW LAW WOULD ASK OUR
MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES TO DECIDE WHAT SEXUAL
BEHAVIOR IS IMMORAL. THIS IS NOT THEIR PROPER
ROLE. JUDGES ARE CERTAINLY WELL EQUIPPED TO
DETERMINE WHAT ACTIVITIES ARE ILLEGAL. BUT THEY
HAVE NO SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR DETERMINING
WHAT ACTIVITIES ARE IMMORAL, AND THEY SHOULD
NOT BE ASKED TO DO IT.
IN OTHER TIMES, A JUDGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO SEEK GUIDANCE FROM RULES OF SEXUAL
BEHAVIOR THAT WERE GENERALLY ACCEPTED BY THE
COMMUNITY. BUT THERE IS NO CONSENSUS IN SOCIETY
TODAY ABOUT SEXUAL MORALITY. THE RULES DIFFER
FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER, AND FROM ONE
ETHNIC GROUP TO ANOTHER. SOME ESPECIALLY OLDER
PEOPLE, REGARD ANY SEX OUTSIDE THE MARRIAGE BED
AS IMMORAL. TO OTHERS, ESPECIALLY YOUNGER
PEOPLE, THE MORAL ISSUES CENTRE ON THE
EXPLOITATION OF ONE PERSON BY ANOTHER, SUCH AS
THE EXPLOITATION OF A WOMAN BY HER HUSBAND.
A JUDGE WOULD HAVE ONLY HIS PERSONAL VIEWS TO
GO BY.
IN SPONSORING THIS AMENDMENT, THE LIBERAL
PARTY HAS NOT THOUGHT MATTERS THROUGH. EITHER
THE WORDS MEAN NOTHING AT ALL - IN WHICH CASE
THEY ARE POINTLESS - OR THEY MAKE IT A CRIME
TO SEEK PARTNERS FOR PERFECTLY LEGAL SEXUAL
ACTIVITIES. THIS IS BAD LAW. YET IN BRITAIN A
SIMILAR LAW HAS BEEN USED AGAINST HOMOSEXUALS
SEEKING WILLING PARTNERS, EVEN THOUGH
HOMOSEXUALITY IN BRITAIN IS NO CRIME. IS THIS
WHAT THE HAMER GOVERNMENT WANTS TO IMPOSE
ON VICTORIA?
THE LIBERAL PARTY MEETING TODAY HAS ONE
LAST CHANCE TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF THIS NONSENSE.
IF IT INTENDS SIMPLY TO CLOSE A LOOPHOLE IN THE
BILL, IT COULD DO SO BY RE-WORDING THE
AMENDMENT TO BAN SOLICITING FOR "ILLEGAL"
PURPOSES RATHER THAN "IMMORAL" ONES, IF NOT,
IT STANDS CONDEMNED FOR INTRODUCING AN
IRRESPONSIBLY VAGUE LAW WHICH COULD SADDLE
VICTORIA WITH A WHOLE NEW RANGE OF VICTIMLESS
CRIMES.
"CONCERN OVER BAIL HEARING"
LAST FRIDAY A MAN APPEARED BEFORE A JUSTICE
OF THE PEACE AT THE MELBOURNE CITY
WATCH HOUSE CHARGED WITH UNLAWFUL
IMPRISONMENT, BLACKMAIL, KIDNAPPING, BURGLARY,
AGGRAVATED BURGLARY AND ASSAULT WITH A WEAPON.
THE HEARING TOOK PLACE AT 6 AM AND THE MAN WAS
RELEASED ON $500 BAIL. THE MINISTER FOR POLICE
AND EMERGENCY SERVICES, MR THOMPSON, HAS
SAID HE WAS "SURPRISED AND MOST CONCERNED"
THAT A PERSON CHARGED WITH KIDNAPPING SHOULD
BE RELEASED ON $500 BAIL. SO HE SHOULD BE. THE
CHARGES ARE SERIOUS. THE FACT THAT THE ACCUSED
MAN WAS A POLICEMAN AT THE TIME OF THE
ALLEGED OFFENCES AND THAT HE WAS RELEASED ON
SUCH A MODEST BAIL AT AN OUT-OF-HOURS HEARING
WILL INEVITABLY GIVE RISE TO PUBLIC SUSPICION THAT
HE WAS GIVEN SPECIAL TREATMENT. NO COMMENT
CAN OR SHOULD BE MADE AT THIS STAGE ON THE FACTS
OF THE CASE, BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH BAIL
WAS GRANTED WARRANT AN IMMEDIATE AND FULL
INQUIRY.
<F64>
WEDNESDAY 17 DECEMBER 1980
"THE FRANKLIN MUST BE SAVED"
THE BEAUTY OF THE WILD, SCENIC RIVERS OF
SOUTH-WEST TASMANIA HAS BECOME KNOWN TO
MILLIONS OF AUSTRALIANS IN RECENT MONTHS THROUGH
BOOKS AND PHOTOGRAPHS. IT IS NOW RECOGNISED AS
ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING FEATURES OF AUSTRALIA'S
HERITAGE, ONE OF THOSE DRAMATIC CREATIONS OF
NATURE WHICH WE SHOULD SAFEGUARD FOR ALL TIME.
YET EVEN AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS
CONSIDERING NOMINATING THE SOUTH-WEST AS ONE
OF THE THREE AUSTRALIAN FEATURES TO BECOME PART
OF THE WORLD HERITAGE LIST, THE RIVERS ARE AGAIN
UNDER THREAT OF BEING FLOODED TO PROVIDE CHEAP
HYDRO-ELECTRICITY.
FIVE MONTHS AGO THE TASMANIAN GOVERNMENT
DECIDED TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN CHEAP ELECTRICITY
AND PRESERVING AUSTRALIA'S HERITAGE BY FLOODING
ONE RIVER, THE LOWER GORDON, WHILE SAVING
ANOTHER, THE FRANKLIN. IT WAS A SECOND BEST
SOLUTION AND, LIKE ALL COMPROMISES, SATISFIED
NO ONE. NOW, AFTER INCESSANT CAMPAIGNING BY
THE HYDRO-ELECTRICITY COMMISSION AND THE
LIBERAL PARTY TO FLOOD THE FRANKLIN, THE COMPRO-
MISE SEEMS LIKELY TO BE REJECTED BY THE STATE'S
CONSERVATIVE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL IN FAVOR OF AN
HEC PLAN TO FLOOD BOTH RIVERS.
IF SO, IT WOULD BE A STEP BACKWARDS INTO
ANOTHER CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN TASMANIA, AND
INTO AN ETHOS WHICH REGARDS NO ENVIRONMENTAL
TREASURE AS SAFE FROM MAN. THE REPORT BY THE
LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL'S COMMITTEE ON THE RIVAL
SCHEMES EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT AT LEAST THE
UPPER PART OF THE FRANKLIN COULD BE SAVED FOR
FUTURE GENERATIONS. SUCH A HOPE IS PROBABLY
NAIVE. IF THE HEC SUCCEEDS IN HAVING THE
DECISION MADE BY THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT
OVERTURNED, IT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY PRESS ON
WITH ITS FEAR CAMPAIGN - WARNING OF CRIPPLING
ELECTRICITY BILLS AND NO POWER FOR INDUSTRY -
UNTIL THE WHOLE OF THE FRANKLIN IS FLOODED, AND
ITS PRIMAEVAL GORGES BECOME ANOTHER HEC LAKE.
THE COUNCIL SHOULD NOT RUSH INTO A DECISION
WHICH WOULD JEOPARDISE THE COMPROMISE THAT
THE GOVERNMENT HAS REACHED. IN A CONFLICT
BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES, THE DEMOCRATICALLY
ELECTED SEAT OF GOVERNMENT MUST PREVAIL OVER
AN UPPER HOUSE ELECTED ON ONE OF AUSTRALIA'S
WORST GERRYMANDERS. THE PREMIER, MR LOWE,
AND HIS GOVERNMENT SHOULD STAND FIRM TO SAVE
THE FRANKLIN. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,
WHICH REPRESENTS ALL AUSTRALIANS, SHOULD USE ITS
INFLUENCE - AND POWER OF THE PURSE - TO ENSURE
THAT THE GORGES OF THE FRANKLIN ARE PRESERVED AS
A NATIONAL PARK FOR AUSTRALIANS, AND THE WORLD,
OF THE FUTURE.
"WRONG BOY FOR THE JOB"
THE APPOINTMENT OF TWO FORMER FRASER
GOVERNMENT MINISTERS, MR GARLAND AND MR
MCLEAY, TO DIPLOMATIC POSTS IN LONDON AND
SAN FRANCISCO RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. ONE
CONCERNS THE GENERAL ISSUE OF POLITICAL
APPOINTMENTS OF THIS KIND. THE OTHER IS SPECIFIC.
SHOULD MR MCLEAY, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY MR
GARLAND, HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FOR THE TWO POSTS,
PARTICULARLY WHEN ONE OF THEM - THAT OF HIGH
COMMISSIONER TO LONDON - IS AT PRESENT
OCCUPIED BY ONE OF AUSTRALIA'S MOST RESPECTED
CAREER DIPLOMATS?
THE CRY OF "JOBS FOR THE BOYS" IS AN
EMOTIVE ONE. IT IMMEDIATELY CONJURES UP THE
SPECTRE OF HAS-BEEN POLITICIANS BEING SHUNTED OFF
ABROAD TO MAKE WAY FOR GREATER TALENT IN THE
MINISTRY AT HOME. YET WHILE THIS IS TRUE OF SOME
OF THE APPOINTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE
PAST, THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS WHERE THE POLITICIAN
IN QUESTION HAS PROVED A FIRST-RATE DIPLOMAT: LORD
CASEY IN WASHINGTON, FOR EXAMPLE, LORD BRUCE
IN LONDON, AND MORE RECENTLY SIR GORDON FREETH
IN TOKYO. FOR THIS REASON WE DO NOT ARGUE THAT
POLITICIANS SHOULD NEVER BE GIVEN DIPLOMATIC
POSTINGS. CLEARLY, IT DEPENDS ON THE CALIBRE OF
THE PERSON AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE JOB.
MR MCLEAY MAY BE A FAIR ENOUGH CHOICE
FOR THE LESSER POST OF CONSUL-GENERAL IN SAN
FRANCISCO. BUT MR GARLAND'S APPOINTMENT IS
ANOTHER MATTER. HE HAS BEEN A RELATIVELY JUNIOR
MINISTER, AND HIS APPOINTMENT WILL MEAN THE
PREMATURE DISPLACEMENT OF SIR JAMES PLIMSOLL,
A DISTINGUISHED CAREER DIPLOMAT WHO IS HELD IN
HIGH REGARD BY THE BRITISH AND WHO HAS DONE
GREAT SERVICE FOR HIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE NOTHING
AGAINST MR GARLAND. THE POINT IS SIMPLY THAT
THERE IS NO REASON FOR THINKING THAT HE WILL DO
THE LONDON JOB AS WELL AS SIR JAMES PLIMSOLL.
<F65>
THURSDAY 18 DECEMBER 1980
"YES, BUT WHY MR KENNETT?"
THE STATE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO BE TAKING A
TURN TO THE RIGHT. IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS
WE HAVE SEEN A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
AMENDMENT TO THE SEXUAL OFFENCES BILL, A DECISION
TO CLOSE FOUR SUBURBAN RAILWAY LINES, AND A
FORESHADOWED CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES
TO PUT ECONOMIC GROWTH FIRST. NOW MR HAMER
HAS CARRIED OUT A CABINET RESHUFFLE IN WHICH
SOME GOOD MOVES MAY BE OVERSHADOWED BY
ONE CURIOUS ONE WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE
CONSERVATIVES MAY HAVE GAINED THE UPPER HAND
IN THE PARTY.
THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW POLICY OF "JOBS
FROM GROWTH" PROMISES TO GIVE TOP PRIORITY TO
EMPLOYMENT. IF SO, THEN MR BRIAN DIXON WAS
A NATURAL CHOICE TO BE ITS MINISTER: A TRAINED
ECONOMIST, HE HAS PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A HARD-
WORKING AND COMPASSIONATE MINISTER WHO IS
PREPARED TO TAKE BOLD ACTION AND IGNORE PARTY
SHIBBOLETHS TO GET THINGS DONE. BUT EVEN MR
DIXON WILL FAIL IN THE JOB UNLESS THE HAMER
GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO PUT ITS MONEY WHERE
ITS MOUTH IS. FOR SIX YEARS, IT HAS DONE LITTLE
FOR THE JOBLESS EXCEPT TALK ABOUT THEM.
MOST OF THE OTHER CHANGES ARE REASONABLE
ENOUGH. MR IAN SMITH, WHO IS SEEN BY RURAL
MPS AS A POTENTIAL PREMIER, SHOULD DO WELL
AS MINISTER FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. MR
TOM AUSTIN IS A LOGICAL CHOICE FOR AGRICULTURE.
MR ALAN WOOD WILL BE BETTER OFF DEALING WITH
INANIMATE BUILDINGS AS MINISTER FOR PUBLIC
WORKS THAN HE WAS DEALING WITH HUMAN BEINGS
AS MINISTER FOR ETHNIC AFFAIRS. THERE MUST BE
RESERVATIONS, HOWEVER, ABOUT MR LOU LIEBERMAN'S
CAPACITY TO HANDLE TWO PORTFOLIOS AS DEMANDING
AS PLANNING AND MINERALS AND ENERGY. BOTH JOBS
REQUIRE A FULL-TIME MINISTER IF THEY ARE TO BE
DONE WELL.
THE STRANGEST ASPECT OF THE RESHUFFLE,
HOWEVER, HAS BEEN THE RISE OF MR JEFF KENNETT.
A MAN OF 32 WHO TERMS HIMSELF "AN OUTSPOKEN
CONSERVATIVE", MR KENNETT HAS BEEN SELECTED FOR
THE MINISTRY OVER MORE ABLE CONTENDERS AND
THEN GIVEN THE SENSITIVE PORTFOLIOS OF HOUSING
AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS. MR KENNETT IS A MAN OF
ENERGY WHO APPARENTLY HAS IMPRESSED SOME
BUSINESS LEADERS, EVEN IF HE OCCASIONALLY ACTS
LIKE A LARRIKIN IN PARLIAMENT. BUT HE WOULD SEEM
TO ADD LITTLE TO A MINISTRY WHICH IS ALREADY
SHORT ON INTELLECTUAL TALENT AND SOCIAL CONCERN.
LET US HOPE WE HAVE MISJUDGED HIM; FOR THE
JOBS AWAITING HIM WILL DEMAND AN UNDERSTANDING
OF SOCIETY VERY MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN
THAT WHICH HE HAS SHOWN TO DATE.
"THE SPECTRE OF TERRORISM"
THE TURKISH CONSUL-GENERAL IN SYDNEY, MR
SARIK ARIYAK, AND HIS BODYGUARD DIED IN
A HAIL OF BULLETS YESTERDAY. THEIR DEATHS -
CLAIMED BY AN ARMENIAN COMMANDO GROUP AS
THEIR WORK - WILL REVIVE MEMORIES OF ANOTHER
UGLY INCIDENT, THE SYDNEY HILTON HOTEL BOMBING
TWO YEARS AGO. THEY ARE A REMINDER (IF REMINDER
IS NEEDED) THAT THE DAYS WHEN AUSTRALIA WAS
REMOTE FROM ACTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE  AND
TERRORISM ARE OVER. TERRORISM IS NOT CONFINED
TO ONE COUNTRY OR ONE GROUP OF COUNTRIES.
TERRORISTS WILL STRIKE WHEREVER THEY THINK THEY
CAN GET THEIR PROTESTS HEARD. MR ARIYAK'S
SHOCKING KILLING, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS ONLY ONE OF
MORE THAN A DOZEN MURDERS OF TURKISH DIPLOMATS
IN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS.
WHAT CAN BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT SUCH
INCIDENTS ARE NOT REPEATED? FOR OPEN SOCIETIES
SUCH AS OURS THERE IS A DILEMMA HERE. OBVIOUSLY,
WHAT HAS TO BE DONE IMMEDIATELY IS WHAT HAS
ALREADY BEEN DONE - TO INCREASE THE GUARD ON
THE TURKISH EMBASSY IN CANBERRA, AND PUT AN
AROUND-THE-CLOCK GUARD ON THE TURKISH CONSULAR
OFFICES IN SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE. THE GROUP
CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YESTERDAY'S DOUBLE
KILLING SAYS "WE WILL STRIKE AGAIN". THE POLICE
AND SECURITY FORCES MUST OBVIOUSLY TAKE THE
WARNING SERIOUSLY.
THE SECOND - AND ALSO OBVIOUS - THING
TO BE DONE IS FOR THE POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
TO WORK MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER IN ORDER TO
NIP WOULD-BE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE BUD. BUT
TO WHAT EXTENT CAN SUCH ACTIONS BE ANTICIPATED?
AND HOW FAR DOES SOCIETY TAKE PROTECTION? DO
WE PUT A RING OF GUARDS OUTSIDE EVERY EMBASSY
AND CONSULATE, AND OUTSIDE EVERY DIPLOMAT'S
HOME? DO WE EXTEND THE KIND OF HEAVY SECURITY
NOW IN VOGUE IN PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,
TO EVERY STATE PARLIAMENT AND EVERY STATE OR
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUILDING? DO WE AGREE TO
HAVE ARMED POLICEMEN ON EVERY CORNER? IN SHORT,
MUST WE FURTHER RESTRICT THE ORDINARY CITIZEN'S
RIGHT OF MOVEMENT TO ENABLE DIPLOMATS,
POLITICIANS AND PUBLIC SERVANTS TO FEEL MORE
SECURE? IT IS AN INVIDIOUS CHOICE. YET IF IT
MUST BE MADE, WE WOULD PREFER THE GOVERNMENT
TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION. DEMOCRACY
CANNOT OPERATE UNDER LOCK AND KEY.
<F66>
FRIDAY 19 DECEMBER 1980
"LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM"
STATE GOVERNMENTS IN VICTORIA HAVE LONG HAD
A PENCHANT FOR APPOINTING EXPENSIVE AND
TIME-CONSUMING PUBLIC INQUIRIES, AND THEN EITHER
IGNORING THEIR KEY RECOMMENDATIONS OR
IMPLEMENTING WHAT COMMON SENSE OR THEIR
POLITICAL INCLINATIONS WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED
ANYWAY.
THE FATE OF THE BAINS REPORT ON LOCAL
GOVERNMENT FALLS INTO THIS FAMILIAR PATTERN. THE
HAMER GOVERNMENT HAS REJECTED, AS WAS TO BE
EXPECTED, THE MAIN PROPOSAL FOR STRUCTURAL
CHANGE, NAMELY THE CREATION OF A GREATER
MELBOURNE COUNCIL. IT HAS ACCEPTED THE MOST
IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION FOR REPRESENTATIONAL
REFORM, NAMELY THE INTRODUCTION OF FULL ADULT
FRANCHISE FOR MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS, WHICH SHOULD
HAVE BEEN ADOPTED LONG AGO. IT IS STILL WONDERING
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE BUMBLING, BICKERING
MELBOURNE CITY COUNCIL, WHICH IT FEELS OUGHT TO
BE CONFINED TO THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT. MR
MALCOLM BAINS, A BRITISH AUTHORITY ON LOCAL
GOVERNMENT, MAY WONDER WHY THE VICTORIAN
GOVERNMENT BOTHERED TO INVITE HIM TO CONDUCT
AN INQUIRY, BUT AT LEAST THERE IS TO BE SOME
MODEST CHANGE TO A SYSTEM THAT IS WIDELY
REGARDED AS UNSATISFACTORY IN MANY ASPECTS.
THE PROPOSED ELECTORAL REFORM ACKNOWLEDGES
THE MODERN TREND, YET TO BE ACCEPTED BY SOME
ENTRENCHED INTERESTS, THAT THE EMPHASIS OF LOCAL
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ON PEOPLE RATHER THAN
PROPERTY. THE UNDEMOCRATIC NATURE OF LOCAL
GOVERNMENT HAS LONG MADE A MOCKERY OF THE
OFT-ASSERTED MYTH THAT IT IS CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE.
"THE VOTE IS NOW RESTRICTED TO THE OCCUPIER OR
OWNER OF PROPERTY", WROTE THE COMMISSION OF
INQUIRY INTO LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN VICTORIA IN
1962, "BUT AS MUCH MUNICIPAL REVENUE IS NOW
DERIVED FROM THE PUBLIC PURSE...THE COMMISSION
CONSIDERS THAT THE ELECTORAL FRANCHISE SHOULD BE
LIBERALISED." IT HAS TAKEN THE GOVERNMENT 18
YEARS AND ANOTHER INQUIRY TO AGREE THAT ALL
ADULT RESIDENTS SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO ELECT THEIR
LOCAL COUNCILS.
TWO OTHER ACCEPTED PROPOSALS SEEM SENSIBLE.
EXPENSE ALLOWANCES FOR COUNCILLORS OF UP TO
$1500 A YEAR WILL OFFER SOME COMPENSATION FOR
THE HOURS OF UNPAID WORK MANY OF THEM
UNDERTAKE EACH WEEK. AUTHORITY TO APPOINT CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE HAD
MUNICIPAL EXPERIENCE SHOULD OPEN LOCAL GOVERN-
MENT ADMINISTRATION - THE STANDARD OF WHICH
VARIES FROM AREA TO AREA - TO A WIDER RANGE OF
EXPERTISE.
THE CONCEPT OF A GREATER MELBOURNE
COUNCIL HAS BEEN MOOTED FOR DECADES AND IT IS
UNDERSTANDABLE THAT IT SHOULD SEEM PERFECTLY
LOGICAL TO AN INDEPENDENT EXPERT SUCH AS MR
BAINS. MELBOURNE IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW
GREAT CITIES OF THE WORLD THAT LACKS A
COMPREHENSIVE FORM OF METROPOLITAN
GOVERNMENT. THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ARE
OBVIOUS: MUDDLED PLANNING, DIVIDED
RESPONSIBILITIES, INADEQUATE REVENUE AND
IMPOVERISHED SERVICES. ROAD WORKS LISTED 50
YEARS AGO AS URGENT HAVE YET TO BE BEGUN. THE
METROPOLIS HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO SPRAWL BEYOND
THE CONVENIENT REACH OF A DILAPIDATED PUBLIC
TRANSPORT SYSTEM. THOUSANDS OF HOMES REMAIN
UNSEWERED. MUCH OF MELBOURNE'S MISFORTUNE
CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A FEDERAL SYSTEM UNDER
WHICH A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF FEDERAL
REVENUE COLLECTED FROM ITS TAXPAYERS IS SPENT
IN OTHER STATES, AND A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF
STATE REVENUE IS SPENT OUTSIDE THE METROPOLITAN
AREA.
THE GOVERNMENT'S REJECTION OF THE NOTION
OF A METROPOLITAN SUPER-COUNCIL IS ALSO
PREDICTABLE, IF NOT ADMIRABLE. SUCH A NEW TIER
OF GOVERNMENT WOULD PRESUMABLY DIMINISH THE
STATUS, POWER AND REVENUE OF STATE GOVERNMENT
AS WELL AS OF LOCAL COUNCILS, AND POLITICIANS
SELDOM WELCOME ANY PROPOSAL THAT REDUCES THEIR
AUTHORITY. A GREATER MELBOURNE COUNCIL, IF
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED, WOULD PROBABLY DIVIDE
ON POLITICAL LINES AND, HORROR OF HORRORS, COULD
FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE LABOR PARTY. NO
WONDER, AS A GOVERNMENT SOURCE CONFIDED
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, "POLITICALLY, IT IS JUST NOT
ON". HOWEVER, THE CONCEPT OF A GREATER
MELBOURNE COUNCIL, ALTHOUGH NOT NECESSARILY IN
THE FORM SUGGESTED BY MR BAINS, HAS ATTRACTIONS.
THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS IT SHOULD BE AN EXPANDED
AND MORE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED BOARD OF WORKS,
WHICH REQUIRES FURTHER STRUCTURAL REFORM AND A
BROADER REVENUE BASE.
THE GOVERNMENT'S MOST IMMEDIATE DILEMMA
IS WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT MONUMENT TO CIVIC
PRETENTIOUSNESS, INTRIGUE AND INCOMPETENCE,
THE MELBOURNE CITY COUNCIL. ITS INCLINATION IS
TO CONFINE THE COUNCIL'S JURISDICTION TO THE
CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT, AS WELL AS TO RATIONALISE
ITS STRUCTURE. THIS WOULD RESOLVE THE PRESENT
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN THE BUSINESS
(MAINLY RETAIL) CONSTITUENTS AND THE RESIDENTIAL
WARDS, WHICH WOULD PRESUMABLY BE CEDED TO
NEIGHBORING INNER SUBURBAN COUNCILS. ONE
PROBLEM IS THAT THIS WOULD STRIP THE COUNCIL OF
SOME OF ITS ABLEST AND MOST PROGRESSIVE
REPRESENTATIVES. ANOTHER IS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE
WHO WORK OR SHOP IN THE CITY, OR WHO USE ITS
SERVICES AND AMENITIES, ACTUALLY LIVE THERE. WHO
IS THEN TO FORM THE COUNCIL'S ELECTORATE? ONE
POSSIBLE SOLUTION COULD BE TO HAND OVER THE MAIN
RESPONSIBILITIES (ESPECIALLY FOR PLANNING) AND
MOST OF THE REVENUES OF THE MELBOURNE CITY
COUNCIL, IF CONFINED TO THE CENTRAL BUSINESS
DISTRICT, TO A REFORMED BOARD OF WORKS. THERE
COULD THEN BE A SMALL COUNCIL CONSISTING OF A
LORD MAYOR AND ALDERMEN FOR ADVISORY AND CERE-
MONIAL PURPOSES.
<F67>
SATURDAY 20 DECEMBER 1980
"REAGAN AND HIS WARY HAWKS"
FOR A CANDIDATE WHO CAMPAIGNED ACROSS THE
NATION EARLIER THIS YEAR PROMISING TO BRING
EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT BACK TO AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT AND TO LEAD AN ADMINISTRATION WHICH
WOULD GET THE COUNTRY GOING AGAIN, RONALD
REAGAN HAS BEEN MAKING SURPRISINGLY HEAVY
WEATHER OF PUTTING TOGETHER HIS NEW CABINET.
WITH ONLY A MONTH REMAINING BEFORE HE TAKES
THE OATH OF OFFICE AND ASSUMES THE STAGGERING
BURDEN OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY, MR REAGAN
IS STILL STRUGGLING TO FILL THE LAST FEW CABINET
POSITIONS. HE HAS LEFT HIMSELF PRECIOUS LITTLE
TIME TO RECRUIT THE SECOND AND THIRD LEVEL
ADMINISTRATORS, THOSE DEPUTY AND ASSISTANT
SECRETARIES WHO ARE THE SOURCE OF NEW IDEAS
AND OPERATIONAL INITIATIVES IN THE CUMBERSOME
AMERICAN SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.
IN HIS DAYS AS GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, MR
REAGAN WAS KNOWN AS A LAID-BACK LEADER, A
CAPTAIN WHO WAS CONTENT TO SET THE COURSE AND
LEAVE IT TO OTHERS TO WORK THE SHIP. BUT IN THE
PAST FEW WEEKS HE HAS SPENT SO MUCH TIME
RELAXING ON HIS CALIFORNIAN RANCH OR SHUT AWAY
IN HIS PACIFIC PALISADES HOME THAT THERE HAVE
BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW MUCH SAY HE HAS
HAD EVEN IN THE CHOICE OF HIS NEW CREW.
BUT SO FAR, AT LEAST, MR REAGAN HAS BEEN
FAITHFUL TO HIS ELECTION PROMISE TO HEAD AN
ADMINISTRATION OF EFFICIENT MANAGERS RATHER
THAN PASSIONATE IDEOLOGUES. AMONG THE 10
ALREADY NAMED, ONLY ONE MEETS THE SEVERE
IDEOLOGICAL STANDARDS OF THE NEW RIGHT, WHICH
HAS BOASTFULLY CLAIMED CREDIT FOR MR REAGAN'S
LANDSLIDE VICTORY LAST MONTH. HE IS MR DAVID
STOCKMAN, A YOUNG TWO-TERM CONGRESSMAN, A
SELF-DESCRIBED FANATIC IN HIS DEVOTION TO MINIMAL
GOVERNMENT AND "SUPPLY-SIDE" ECONOMICS, WHO
WILL DIRECT THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND
BUDGET. MR STOCKMAN HAS ALREADY WARNED THE
PRESIDENT-ELECT THAT HE FACES AN "ECONOMIC
DUNKIRK" UNLESS HE MOVES QUICKLY TO CUT
GOVERNMENT AND PROVIDE THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH
THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES HE BELIEVES ARE NECESSARY
TO RESTORE PRODUCTIVITY.
THE OTHERS FOR THE MOST PART ARE GOOD
CONSERVATIVES, SOLID MEN OF THE REPUBLICAN
ESTABLISHMENT. PRAGMATISTS RATHER THAN
INNOVATORS, THEY ARE KNOWN (AND PRESUMABLY
WERE CHOSEN) FOR THEIR PROVEN RECORDS IN BUSINESS
MANAGEMENT, THEIR PERFORMANCES IN PAST
REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS OR THEIR PERSONAL
LOYALTY TO MR REAGAN HIMSELF.
TO PRESIDE OVER AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY
FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, MR REAGAN HAS CHOSEN A
TRIUMVIRATE OF WARY HAWKS. HOW HAWKISH
REMAINS TO BE SEEN, BUT GENERAL ALEXANDER HAIG
AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, MR CASPAR WEINBERGER
IN THE PENTAGON AND MR WILLIAM CASEY AT THE
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY ALL SHARE MR
REAGAN'S JUDGMENT THAT THE UNITED STATES AND ITS
ALLIES HAVE ENTERED A PERIOD OF STRATEGIC PERIL
WHICH THEY WILL SURVIVE UNSCATHED ONLY BY
RIGOROUS REARMAMENT AND BY KEEPING A BEADY
EYE ON THE RUSSIANS.
GENERAL HAIG, A KISSINGER-NIXON PROTEGE,
WILL HAVE A HARD TIME OF IT WHEN HE COMES BEFORE
THE SENATE FOR CONFIRMATION NEXT MONTH. HIS
CRITICS CLAIM THAT HE IS TAINTED BY VIETNAM AND
WATERGATE. BUT HE SEEMS CERTAIN TO SURVIVE
CONGRESSIONAL SCRUTINY. AND HE COULD EMERGE
AS A STRONG AND ASSERTIVE SECRETARY OF STATE, IF
ONLY BECAUSE MR REAGAN HIMSELF IS INEXPERIENCED
IN MATTERS OF FOREIGN POLICY, MR WEINBERGER IS
AN ADMINISTRATOR WITH LITTLE BACKGROUND IN
DEFENCE OR STRATEGY, AND MR CASEY IS AN OLD
WARTIME PROFESSIONAL, MORE CONCERNED WITH THE
NUTS AND BOLTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE OPERATION THAN
WITH ITS STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS. GENERAL HAIG'S
CURRENT OPINIONS ON THE MIDDLE EAST, SOUTH-
WEST ASIA AND OTHER TROUBLE SPOTS ARE NOT
KNOWN. BUT HIS APPOINTMENT, LIKE THOSE OF MR
WEINBERGER AND MR CASEY, OFFERS LITTLE EVIDENCE
TO SUPPORT PRESIDENT CARTER'S CAMPAIGN
PREDICTION THAT MR REAGAN IS A RECKLESS MAN,
NOT TO BE TRUSTED TO KEEP THE WORLD AT PEACE AND
THE NATION OUT OF WAR.
NOT ALL MR REAGAN'S TROUBLES IN ASSEMBLING
A CABINET OF TALENTS HAVE BEEN OF HIS OWN
MAKING. SOME OF THE MORE EXPERIENCED
ADMINISTRATORS AND BUSINESSMEN HE HAD HOPED
TO RECRUIT SHIED AWAY WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE
NEW "ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT" REGULATIONS WHICH
WOULD HAVE FORCED THEM TO DECLARE AND PERHAPS TO
DIVEST THEIR PRIVATE HOLDINGS. OTHERS APPARENTLY
COULD NOT PASS THE TEST. MOREVER, HE HAS HAD
TO WEIGH THE COMPETING IDEOLOGICAL PRESSURES
IN THE NEW AND STILL UNSTABLE CONSERVATIVE
COALITION HE COMMANDS.
ON BALANCE, HE HAS COME DOWN SOLIDLY SO
FAR ON THE SIDE OF MODERATION. IF PRESIDENTS ARE
TO BE JUDGED BY THE COMPANY THEY CHOOSE, THE
REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IS LIKELY TO BE MUCH
LESS ADVENTUROUS - AND CERTAINLY MUCH LESS
SCARY - THAN HIS MORE EXTRAVAGANT CAMPAIGN
STATEMENTS HAD IMPLIED. MR REAGAN IS SAID TO
HAVE CHOSEN FOUR PRESIDENTIAL PORTRAITS TO
DECORATE THE WALLS OF THE CABINET ROOM. THEY
ARE ABRAHAM LINCOLN, TEDDY ROOSEVELT, DWIGHT
EISENHOWER AND CALVIN COOLIDGE. JUDGED BY THE
COMPOSITION OF HIS CABINET, EISENHOWER AND
COOLIDGE COULD BE THE MORE INFLUENTIAL SPIRITS.
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
THIS SCIENTIFIC AGE HAS SPAWNED A RANGE OF
NEW PROFESSIONS WHOSE NAMES INTRIGUE THE
IMAGINATIONS OF ORDINARY PERSONS. PRACTITIONERS
OF SUCH SCIENCES AS CRYONOLOGY, CYBERNETICS AND
GAITOLOGY OFFER THEIR SERVICES, ALONG WITH THE
FUTUROLOGISTS.
WHATEVER THE PROSPECTS FOR THE OTHERS,
FUTUROLOGISTS SHOULD BE ASSURED OF A ROSY FUTURE.
ALREADY THEY ARE ATTRACTING ENVIABLE FEES. ONE
FIRM WAS RECENTLY ENGAGED BY A GROUP OF
AUSTRALIAN CORPORATIONS AT THE COST OF A SMALL
FORTUNE TO FORECAST THEIR BUSINESS PROSPECTS FOR
THE YEARS IMMEDIATELY AHEAD. THEY SHOULD
CONTINUE TO THRIVE, SINCE THE DESIRE TO KNOW
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS BORN INTO THE TEXTURE
OF HUMAN NATURE.
OUR FUTUROLOGISTS ARE NOT, OF COURSE, TO BE
CONFUSED WITH CLAIRVOYANTS, TEACUP READERS,
HIEROSCOPISTS OR NECROMANCERS. NOR ARE THEIR
TOOLS OF TRADE SUCH CONTROVERSIAL DEVICES AS
CRYSTAL BALLS, OUIJA BOARDS OR PLANCHETTES. THEIRS
IS A MORE SCIENTIFIC APPROACH.
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE COURSE AHEAD MAY BE
PROJECTED FROM A STUDY OF THE PAST. THEIR
ANALYSES OF PREVIOUS ECONOMIC BOOMS AND
DEPRESSIONS, INFLATION AND DEFLATION, INVESTMENT
GRAPHS, SALES STATISTICS AND OTHER RELEVANT DATA
ARE PROCESSED BY COMPUTERS WHICH PRINT OUT
LIKELY FUTURE TRENDS. THESE ELECTRONIC PROPHETS,
HOWEVER, WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT THEIRS
IS NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE. THEY CAN BUT MAKE
SCIENTIFICALLY CALCULATED GUESSES AT THE FUTURE'S
PROBABLE COURSE.
OUR AGE, FOR ALL ITS KNOWLEDGE, HAS NOT YET
PRODUCED ANY PROGNOSTICATORS WHO CAN BE CERTAIN
OF WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS. NO OPINION POLLSTERS
CAN PROVIDE A PRECISE PREDICTION OF THE OUTCOME
OF ELECTIONS. THE BEST DOCTORS' PROGNOSES ARE
SOMETIMES WIDE OF THE MARK. THE METEOROLOGISTS'
COMPUTERS OCCASIONALLY ERR IN FORECASTING EVEN
THE NEXT DAY'S TEMPERATURE.
IN ONE WAY THAT IS A PITY. AN ACCURATE
PREVIEW OF THE FUTURE WOULD BE INVALUABLE
TO INVESTORS, PUNTERS, FASHION DESIGNERS,
MANUFACTURERS AND OTHERS WHOSE BUSINESS IS
SUBJECT TO CHANGE - NOT TO MENTION ORGANISERS
OF SUNDAY SCHOOL PICNICS. IT WOULD ALSO
ENCOURAGE US TO ANTICIPATE FORTHCOMING, BUT
UN-GUESSED, PLEASURES.
ON BALANCE, HOWEVER, SUCH FOREKNOWLEDGE
WOULD BE A MIXED BLESSING. A PROJECTION OF
TRAGEDIES WE ARE TO RUN INTO, LOSSES WE WILL
SUSTAIN, BEREAVEMENTS WE ARE TO SUFFER, COULD
FILL OUR OUTLOOK WITH FOREBODING.
IT ALSO WOULD ROB LIFE OF THAT ELEMENT OF
SURPRISE WHICH IS HALF THE JOY OF LIVING. THERE IS
A SENSE OF ADVENTURE IN GREETING EACH MORNING
NOT KNOWING WHAT THE DAY'S UNFOLDING HOURS
WILL BRING.
SUCH REFLECTIONS ARISE AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO
1981. NOBODY CAN TELL WHAT THE YEAR HOLDS. NONE
CAN FORESEE THE OUTCOME OF THE AFGHANISTAN
SITUATION, HOW THE IRAQI-IRANIAN WAR WILL END,
WHAT NEXT QUARTER'S INFLATION RATE WILL BE, OR
WHO WILL WIN THE GRAND FINAL.
A MERCIFUL PROVIDENCE HAS VEILED THE FUTURE
FROM OUR VIEW. BEYOND THE INEVITABILITY OF DEATH
AT SOME FUTURE DATE, "WE KNOW NOT WHAT A DAY
OR AN HOUR MAY BRING FORTH". AT THE OPENING OF
ANOTHER UNCERTAIN YEAR, WISDOM LIES IN HEEDING
THE INJUNCTION TO LIVE ONE DAY AT A TIME, AND IN
THE FAITH THAT "GOD HOLDS THE KEY TO ALL
UNKNOWN".

MONDAY 22 DECEMBER 1980
"GOVERNMENT DODGES SEX"
THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO GIVE
PARENTS CONTROL OF SEX EDUCATION IN STATE
SECONDARY SCHOOLS - NOT ONLY FOR THEIR OWN
CHILDREN BUT FOR THOSE OF OTHERS - IS A COWARDLY
ABROGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY AND RATIONALITY.
AFTER DITHERING FOR 14 MONTHS ON WHAT WAS
OFFICIALLY CALLED A "REVIEW" OF GUIDELINES ON
"HEALTH AND HUMAN RELATIONS EDUCATION", THE
GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO HAVE SUCCUMBED TO THE
AGITATION OF A SMALL PRESSURE GROUP WHICH FEELS
THAT ADOLESCENTS SHOULD BE (AND CAN BE) SHIELDED
FROM KNOWLEDGE, DISCUSSION AND POSSIBLE
INFLUENCES OF WHICH ITS MEMBERS DISAPPROVE. A
GOVERNMENT HAS TO TAKE SUCH VIEWS INTO ACCOUNT
AND AVOID GIVING NEEDLESS OFFENCE, BUT NOT AT
THE EXPENSE OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE AND
INTEGRITY. IT ALSO HAS A MUCH WIDER
RESPONSIBILITY, NOT ONLY TO THE SILENT MAJORITY OF
PARENTS BUT TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO SOCIETY AS
A WHOLE.
UNDER THE REVISED GUIDELINES, STATE HIGH AND
TECHNICAL SCHOOLS OFFERING HUMAN RELATIONS
COURSES WILL BE REQUIRED TO APPOINT A PARENT-
DOMINATED COMMITTEE TO DETERMINE THEIR
CONTENT AND TEACHING METHODS. CHILDREN TAKING
PART IN SUCH COURSES, IF CONSIDERED CONTROVERSIAL,
WILL NEED WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THEIR PARENTS
TO ATTEND. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL PARENTS WILL
HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW THEIR CHILDREN FROM
ANY PART OF A PROGRAMME TO WHICH THEY OBJECT.
SUCH DEFERENCE TO PARENTAL PARTICIPATION AND
AUTHORITY MIGHT BE CREDIBLE IF SECONDARY
SCHOOLS WERE GENERALLY GOVERNED BY PARENTS'
REPRESENTATIVES. BUT WHILE GREATER PARENT AND
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN EDUCATION IS A
WELCOME TREND, COURSE CONTENT AND TEACHING
METHODS ARE NORMALLY REGARDED AS MATTERS FOR
PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT. TO SINGLE OUT SEX
EDUCATION FOR COMPLICATED SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS
IS ABSURD. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR INCLUDING
EDUCATION ON SEXUALITY AND HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS
IN SCHOOL CURRICULA IS THAT MANY PARENTS FEEL
TOO ILL-EQUIPPED OR INHIBITED TO GIVE THEIR
CHILDREN ALL THE INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE TO
WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED. AND IF THERE IS TO BE
MEANINGFUL SEX EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS, IT IS BEST
IMPARTED IN A CONTEXT THAT DOES NOT SET IT APART
AS SOMETHING FRAUGHT WITH CONTROVERSY AND
EMBARRASSMENT.
THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH IS ILLOGICAL AND
IMPRACTICAL, UNLESS ITS AIM IS TO DISCOURAGE SEX
EDUCATION IN THE CLASSROOM FROM RISING ABOVE
THE BIRDS AND THE BEES LEVEL. ONLY A FEW MONTHS
AGO, THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, MR
LACY, WHO ANNOUNCED THE NEW GUIDELINES ON
FRIDAY, REJECTED COMPLAINTS THAT THE HEALTH AND
HUMAN RELATIONS COURSE DEVISED BY THE SOCIAL
BIOLOGY CENTRE WAS INSENSITIVE OR CALCULATED TO
INDOCTRINATE STUDENTS WITH PERMISSIVE VIEWS.
THE REALITY IS THAT THOUSANDS OF TEENAGERS
ALREADY ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE, OFTEN WITH
INADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE OR CARE FOR THE
CONSEQUENCES. NEITHER PARENTAL DISAPPROVAL NOR
GOVERNMENT ACTION CAN SHIELD THEM FROM THE
PRESSURES AND TEMPTATIONS TO WHICH THEY ARE
EXPOSED. THE BEST THE COMMUNITY CAN DO IS TO
GIVE THEM AN UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR OWN
SEXUALITY, ENCOURAGE A RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS AND
FEELINGS OF OTHERS, AND HELP THEM COPE
RESPONSIBLY WITH DECISIONS THEY MUST ULTIMATELY
MAKE FOR THEMSELVES.
THE NEW GUIDELINES WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO
ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES. SCHOOLS NOW WILL
HAVE TO MAKE A POSITIVE DECISION TO ADOPT SEX
EDUCATION, RATHER THAN TO OPT OUT. VIEWS OF
PARENTS' COMMITTEES WILL PREDOMINATE, AND IT IS
IN THE NATURE OF SUCH COMMITTEES THAT THEY ARE
SWAYED BY A VOCIFEROUS MINORITY WITH STRONG
OPINIONS RATHER THAN THAT THEY REFLECT CONSENSUS.
THE RESULT MAY BE THAT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN
RELATIONS COURSES WILL BE LESS RATHER THAN MORE
WIDELY TAUGHT, AND THAT CHILDREN MOST IN NEED
OF INFORMATION AND HELP WILL BE THE LEAST LIKELY
TO GET IT. AS PARENTS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW THEIR CHILDREN FROM A
PROGRAMME TO WHICH THEY OBJECT, IT IS SURELY
UNNECESSARY AND UNFAIR TO ALLOW A PARENTS'
COMMITTEE ALSO TO VETO A PROGRAMME WHICH
OTHER PARENTS, EVEN IF IN A MINORITY AT A
PARTICULAR SCHOOL, MAY WISH THEIR CHILDREN TO
ATTEND. IT IS PROPER THAT PARENTS SHOULD BE
INVOLVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR CHILDREN'S
EDUCATION. BUT BY SINGLING OUT SEX EDUCATION FOR
SPECIAL TREATMENT, THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN
EXAGGERATED DEFERENCE TO THE VIEWS OF A
VOCIFEROUS MINORITY OF PARENTS AT THE EXPENSE OF
A WIDER COMMUNITY INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT THE
RIGHTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO KNOWLEDGE AND
GUIDANCE ARE MET BY THOSE PROFESSIONALLY AND
ETHICALLY QUALIFIED TO DO SO.
"THE PLIGHT OF KIM DAE-JUNG"
NEARLY ALL MEANS OF APPEAL TO SAVE THE LIFE
OF KIM DAE-JUNG, THE SOUTH KOREAN
OPPOSITION LEADER, HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED. IT IS
LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE HANGED WITHIN A FEW WEEKS.
THE AUTHORITIES IN SEOUL HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR A
DECADE TO SILENCE THIS CHARISMATIC FIGURE WHO
CAME WITHIN AN ACE OF DEFEATING PRESIDENT PARK
IN THE 1971 ELECTION, SIGNIFICANTLY THE LAST SUCH
POLL TO BE HELD. THEY HAVE USED HARASSMENT,
PERSECUTION, MALTREATMENT, HOUSE - ARREST
CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE, TRUMPED-UP PROSECUTIONS
AND PROTRACTED SPELLS OF IMPRISONMENT. THEY
HAVE ABDUCTED HIM FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY. THUGS
HAVE TRIED TO KILL HIM ON THE STREETS. BUT MR KIM
HAS KEPT TALKING. HE HAS SPOKEN OUT CONSISTENTLY
FOR DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN A NATION
WHOSE AUTHORITARIAN RULERS HAVE SACRIFICED
ELEMENTARY FREEDOMS TO THEIR OBSESSIVE APPETITE
FOR SECURITY AGAINST THE ORWELLIAN HORRORS OF THE
NORTH.
THE IRONY OF IT ALL IS THAT MR KIM, TOO, IS
STAUNCHLY ANTI-COMMUNIST. THERE IS NO PERSUASIVE
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST, AS THE REGIME HAS, THAT HE
HAS BEEN IN CAHOOTS WITH NORTH KOREA OR THAT
HE HAS INSTIGATED VIOLENT REBELLION. HIS ABIDING
THEME IS THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY TO
SOUTH KOREA BY PEACEFUL MEANS. THAT, IT SEEMS,
IS A TREASONABLE OFFENCE. PRESIDENT CHUN HAS
ISOLATED THE ONE PERSON WHO COULD PROVIDE A REAL
ALTERNATIVE TO THE OPPRESSIVE POLICIES IN VOGUE
FOR MANY YEARS. SO MR KIM, HIS HEALTH RUINED, THE
DISSIDENT ON WHOM THE AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT BEEN
ABLE TO PIN ANYTHING, AWAITS EXECUTION. THOSE IN
THE WEST WHO FOUGHT AND SURVIVED THE KOREAN
WAR MIGHT BE WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH IT WAS
ALL FOR.
<F69>
WEDNESDAY 24 DECEMBER 1980
"SOME REAL CIVIC REFORM AT LAST"
THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO DISMISS
THE MELBOURNE CITY COUNCIL IS A WELCOME
CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR THE PEOPLE OF MELBOURNE.
THE COUNCIL HAS LONG BEEN, AS WE DESCRIBED IT
LAST WEEK, A MONUMENT TO CIVIC
PRETENTIOUSNESS, INTRIGUE AND INCOMPETENCE. THE
YEARS OF COSTLY DITHERING OVER THE CITY
SQUARE AND BOURKE STREET MALL, AND THE
BUMBLING FICKLENESS OVER PLANNING, ARE JUST TWO
EXAMPLES OF THE COUNCIL'S DEFICIENCIES. IN THE
PAST WEEKS THERE HAVE BEEN ALLEGATIONS OF GRAFT
AND CORRUPTION AS WELL. FOLLOWING THE
SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLE OF SYDNEY CITY COUNCIL'S
REFORM IN 1967, THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO
REPLACE THE MCC WITH ADMINISTRATORS UNTIL A
MORE EFFECTIVE STRUCTURE CAN BE FORMED. THE
COUNCIL'S JURISDICTION IS TO BE REDUCED TO THE
CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT AND IMMEDIATELY
SURROUNDING RESIDENTIAL AREAS, THE NUMBER OF
COUNCILLORS IS TO BE REDUCED FROM 26 TO 12, AND
THE LORD MAYOR IS TO BE ELECTED FOR A FOUR-YEAR
TERM BY CITY RATEPAYERS. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT
REFORM WAS URGENTLY NECESSARY, BUT IT IS TOO
SOON TO JUDGE HOW WELL THE PROPOSED CHANGES
ARE LIKELY TO WORK. MUCH WILL DEPEND ON THE
CALIBRE OF THE COUNCILLORS TO BE ELECTED BY A
MORE STRONGLY BUSINESS-ORIENTED CONSTITUENCY.
AND IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT SOME OF
THE CITY'S PROBLEMS ARE AS MUCH THE FAULT OF
THE GOVERNMENT'S AS OF THE COUNCIL'S. BUT AT
LEAST THERE WILL BE A BRIGHTER PROSPECT FOR LIFTING
MELBOURNE FROM THE DOLDRUMS.
"A CHRISTMAS REFLECTION"
UNTIL RECENT YEARS THE INFLUENCE OF THE
NORTHERN HEMISPHERE ON OUR NATION'S WAY
OF LIFE WAS VIVIDLY REFLECTED IN THE WAY WE
CELEBRATED CHRISTMAS.
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS BROUGHT WITH THEIR
CABIN TRUNKS AND ACCENTS THE CHRISTMAS CUSTOMS
THEY HAD ALWAYS OBSERVED IN BRITAIN, WHERE THE
SEASON OCCURS IN MID-WINTER.
IT WAS NATURAL THAT, IN THEIR NOSTALGIA, THEY
SHOULD CELEBRATE THE FESTIVE SEASON HERE WITH
THE HOT ROASTS AND PLUM PUDDINGS THEY HAD
TRADITIONALLY ENJOYED THERE, ADORN THEIR GREETING
CARDS WITH PICTURES OF LOG FIRES AND SNOW-DECKED
TREES, AND SING CAROLS THEY HAD SUNG FROM
CHILDHOOD IN THEIR HOMELAND. SANTA CLAUS IS
STILL THE OLD GENTLEMEN WHO ACCOMPANIED THEM,
PERSPIRING IN A COSTUME DESIGNED TO SURVIVE
EUROPE'S ICY BLASTS - AND NOT YET APPROPRIATELY
ATTIRED FOR OUR SCORCHING DECEMBER DAYS.
BUT THINGS ARE GRADUALLY CHANGING.
INCREASINGLY, CHRISTMAS CARDS DEPICT SCENES BY
AUSTRALIAN ARTISTS. SOME CAROLS, BY LOCAL
COMPOSERS, NOW BREATHE AN AUSTRALIAN
ATMOSPHERE. OUR CHRISTMAS DINNERS INCLUDE MORE
COLD COURSES: COLLATIONS, SALADS AND ICECREAM -
OR SIZZLING STEAKS GRILLED ON OUTDOOR BARBECUES.
OTHER NATIONS FOLLOW DIFFERENT CHRISTMAS
CUSTOMS WHICH THEIR CULTURES HAVE EVOLVED OVER
MANY CENTURIES. A TYPICAL, LOCAL AND RECENT
EXAMPLE OF THE CROSS-CULTURAL APPEAL OF
CHRISTMAS IS SEEN IN INLAND AUSTRALIA. WHEN
WHITE CHRISTIANS FIRST SHARED THE ADVENT
MESSAGE WITH THE ABORIGINAL PEOPLE, THEY TRIED
TO DO SO IN EUROPEAN TERMS - A CULTURE ALIEN TO
A RACE WHICH HAD BROUGHT OUT OF THE DREAMTIME
ITS OWN FAITH AND TRADITIONS. UNDERSTANDABLY,
CHRISTIANITY MADE LITTLE APPEAL TO THEM.
GENERALLY THEY DISREGARDED THE WHITE MAN'S
FAITH AS UNINTELLIGIBLE TO THEIR WAY OF THINKING,
AND IRRELEVANT TO THEIR WAY OF LIFE.
HOWEVER, AMONG SOME TRIBES, ABORIGINES
WHO HAVE EMBRACED THE CHRISTIAN WAY HAVE
DISCOVERED THEY CAN INTERPRET CHRISTMAS IN TERMS
OF THEIR OWN CULTURE: EXPRESS IT IN THEIR OWN
LANGUAGE, CELEBRATE ITS MESSAGE IN THEIR
CORROBOREE, AND DEPICT IT IN THE SYMBOLISM OF
THEIR OWN ART. SO PRESENTED, THE BABY OF THE
CHRISTMAS STORY IS FOUND TO BE AS MUCH AT HOME
IN A WAILBRI CAMP AS IN A PALESTINIAN CATTLE STALL,
AN AFRICAN KRAAL OR A WESTERN CATHEDRAL.
SUCH ADAPTATIONS OF THE FESTIVAL EMPHASISE
THAT CHRISTMAS DOES NOT BELONG TO ANY SPECIFIC
CLIMATE, COUNTRY OR CULTURE. THE MESSAGE OF
CHRISTMAS WAS ORIGINALLY ANNOUNCED AS "GOOD
NEWS TO ALL PEOPLE". IT IS NATIVE TO THE WHOLE
EARTH.
ALTHOUGH THE BIRTH OF THE BABY IT
COMMEMORATES OCCURRED AT ONE SPOT ON EARTH,
HE HIMSELF IS INDIGENOUS TO EVERY RACE AND
NATION IN EVERY AGE. THE SPIRIT OF PEACE AND
GOOD WILL HE BRINGS IS FELT BY ALL WHO RECEIVE
HIM. WHEREVER HE IS ACCEPTED, TRANSFORMATION
OF LIFE FOLLOWS.
THE CHANGE THIS CHILD EFFECTS IS SUBTLY
SUGGESTED IN ONE OF BRET HARTE'S STORIES, SET IN
A MINING SETTLEMENT IN AMERICA'S WILD WEST. IN
HARTE'S TALE, ROARING CAMP HAS A NOTORIOUS
REPUTATION FOR LAWLESSNESS. WHEN MINERS ARGUE
OVER THEIR CARDS THEY SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES
WITH PISTOLS, WHILE OTHER GAMBLERS QUIETLY
PROCEED WITH THEIR PLAY: MURDER IS A NORMAL PART
OF THEIR CODE.
THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE CAMP DIES IN
CHILDBIRTH BUT HER ORPHANED BABY SURVIVES. THE
MINERS ADOPT THE BOY, LEFT LYING IN A BOX OF OLD
RAGS, AND AGREE TO DO THEIR BEST FOR HIM.
EVERYBODY FEELS THAT THE OLD BOX IS NOT GOOD
ENOUGH, SO THEY SEND ONE OF THEIR NUMBER 128
KILOMETRES TO SACRAMENTO TO BUY A ROSEWOOD
CRADLE - THE BEST HE CAN FIND.
AS RAGS NOW SEEM OUT OF PLACE, THE MAN
IS SENT BACK FOR THE MOST ATTRACTIVE LACE COVERS
AVAILABLE. BUT WHEN THE INFANT, REPOSING AMONG
THE SNOWY COVERLETS OF THE ROSEWOOD CRADLE, IS
PLACED IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM, THE MEN NOTICE
WHAT HAD ESCAPED THEIR ATTENTION: THE FLOOR IS
FILTHY. SO THEY SET TO WORK TO SCRUB IT.
THEY CONSIDER THAT TO MATCH THE CLEAN FLOOR,
THE ROSEWOOD CRADLE AND WHITE LACE, THE WALLS
NEED TO BE WHITEWASHED AND THE WINDOWS
REPAIRED AND CURTAINED.
FURTHER, THE BABY NEEDS LONG PERIODS OF
SILENCE WHILE HE SLEEPS; SO ROARING CAMP CEASES
TO ROAR. WHEN THE MEN CARRY THE CRADLE TO THE
MINE ON SUNNY DAYS, THE PLACE SEEMS SO DREARY
IT HAS TO BE TIDIED; SO THEY PLANT GARDENS AROUND
THE SPOT WHERE THE CRADLE STANDS.
THE SHREWD STOREKEEPER, PERCEIVING WHAT IS
HAPPENING, DISCREETLY PLACES MIRRORS WHERE THE
MINERS CATCH THEIR OWN REFLECTIONS AS THEY LOUNGE
AND SMOKE. SOON THEY ARE BUYING SOAP AND
SHAVING-GEAR - EVEN NEW CLOTHES ..... THE
COMING OF THE BABY CHANGED EVERYTHING AND
EVERYBODY IN ROARING CAMP.
ALTHOUGH HARTE'S STORY IS FICTIONAL AND
DATED, ITS ALLEGORICAL MEANING WAS NEVER MORE
TRUE AND RELEVANT. TODAY'S ROARING SOCIETY, TORN
BY DIVISIONS, ROCKED BY VIOLENCE, RIDDLED WITH
CRIME, CORRUPTED BY GREED, NEEDS A UNIFYING
FACTOR WHICH HUMAN INGENUITY HAS FAILED TO
DEVISE.
HISTORY SHOWS THAT WHEREVER PEOPLE ADOPT
THE BABY OF THE CHRISTMAS STORY, VALUES CHANGE,
STANDARDS RISE, LIFE ASSUMES A NEW PURPOSE AND
DIGNITY; RECONCILIATION IS EFFECTED - AS THE BABY
BROUGHT PEACE AND GOOD WILL WHEN HE WAS
ACCEPTED BY THE SINISTER SOCIETY OF ROARING
CAMP.

SATURDAY 27 DECEMBER 1980
"QUESTIONS FOR MR MACLELLAN"
THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT, MR MACLELLAN, IS
LOSING THE BATTLE OF PUBLIC OPINION OVER HIS
PLANS TO CLOSE RAILWAY PASSENGER SERVICES.
THREE WEEKS AGO THE MINISTER PERSUADED STATE
CABINET TO TAKE THE DRASTIC STEP OF CLOSING
PASSENGER SERVICES ON FOUR SUBURBAN LINES AND
SEVEN COUNTRY LINES, AND REPLACE THE TRAINS WITH
BUSES. SINCE THEN A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS HAVE
ARISEN ABOUT THE WAY THIS CONTROVERSIAL DECISION
WAS TAKEN - AND MR MACLELLAN SEEMS UNABLE
TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH ANY ANSWERS.
THREE QUESTIONS STAND OUT. THE FIRST: WHY
WERE THESE PARTICULAR LINES SELECTED FOR CLOSURE?
THE UPFIELD LINE, FOR INSTANCE, IS ONE OF VICRAIL'S
BUSIEST LINES, CARRYING 13,000 PASSENGERS A DAY.
YET IT IS TO BE CLOSED WHILE THE ALAMEIN BRANCH
LINE WITH 5100 PASSENGERS AND THE ELTHAM-
HURSTBRIDGE LINE WITH 1700 PASSENGERS BOTH
REMAIN OPEN. IS IT SIMPLY COINCIDENCE THAT THE
FOUR LINES TO BE CLOSED ARE ALL IN SAFE LABOR
ELECTORATES, WHILE LINES WITH LESSER PATRONAGE
IN LIBERAL ELECTORATES ARE BEING KEPT OPEN?
THE SECOND QUESTION: WHY IS THE
GOVERNMENT REFUSING TO RELEASE THE INFORMATION
ABOUT PASSENGER USE AND FINANCIAL LOSSES ON
EACH LINE ON WHICH ITS DECISION WAS BASED?
VICRAIL HAS ALL THIS INFORMATION AT HAND; INDEED,
IT USED TO PUBLISH PASSENGER FIGURES FOR EACH
STATION AS PART OF ITS ANNUAL REPORT. THE
TAXPAYERS WHO PAY FOR THE RAILWAYS, AND THE
PUBLIC WHOSE SERVICES ARE TO BE CLOSED, HAVE A
RIGHT TO KNOW THE FACTS. IF MR MACLELLAN IS
CONFIDENT THAT HE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION, WHAT
POSSIBLE JUSTIFICATION IS THERE FOR TREATING THE
FIGURES AS A STATE SECRET?
THE THIRD QUESTION: WHY HAS THE GOVERNMENT
KEPT SECRET A REPORT BY THE BRITISH CONSULTANTS
TRANSMARK ON THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF RAILWAY
PASSENGER SERVICES? ONE OF THE WEAKNESSES OF
THE LONIE REPORT WAS THAT IT PROVIDED NO DATA
TO BACK UP ITS SWEEPING CONCLUSIONS - LEAVING
THE IMPRESSION THAT THESE WERE BASED ON
PERSONAL OPINIONS RATHER THAN FACTS. THE
TRANSMARK REPORT, BY CONTRAST, IS SAID TO HAVE
CONDUCTED A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF EACH TYPE OF
PASSENGER SERVICE AND PROPOSED A RATHER DIFFERENT
COURSE OF ACTION. AN EARLIER TRANSMARK REPORT
ON VICRAIL'S GRAIN FREIGHT OPERATIONS WAS
RELEASED BY MR MACLELLAN WITHIN DAYS OF ITS
RECEIPT. WHY IS THEIR SECOND REPORT BEING HIDDEN
FROM THE PUBLIC?
THESE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS. IT SEEMS
EXTRAORDINARY THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING
TO CLOSE A SUBURBAN LINE CARRYING 13,000
PASSENGERS A DAY WHEN EVEN IN EFFICIENCY-
CONSCIOUS JAPAN, THE LATEST RATIONALISATION PLAN
ADOPTS 4000 PASSENGERS A DAY AS THE CUTOFF
POINT FOR RETAINING RAILWAY SERVICES RATHER THAN
REPLACING THEM WITH BUSES. IF MR MACLELLAN
FAILS TO MAKE PUBLIC THE INFORMATION ON WHICH
THE DECISION WAS BASED, THE VOTERS MAY CONCLUDE
THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS RESORTING TO BJELKE-
PETERSEN RULE IN WHICH ITS OWN SUPPORTERS ARE
REWARDED AT THE COST OF THE REST OF THE
COMMUNITY.
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
THIS GENERATION IS BEING CONTINUALLY REMINDED
OF THE LIMITED EXTENT OF THE EARTH'S NATURAL
RESOURCES. DEPOSITS SUCH AS COAL, OIL AND
MINERALS ARE FINITE AND NON-RENEWABLE - HENCE
THE NEED TO CONSERVE THEM, ALTHOUGH THEY
MIGHT OUTLAST OUR OWN LIFETIME.
ONE RESOURCE THAT RECEIVES FAR LESS ATTENTION
IS TIME. TIME ALSO RUNS OUT EVENTUALLY. MANY
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD A
BEGINNING AND MUST THEREFORE HAVE AN ENDING,
WHICH MEANS THAT TIME IS FINITE AND, FINALLY,
EXHAUSTIBLE. BUT SINCE ITS ULTIMATE EXTINCTION
APPEARS TO BE IN THE REMOTE, INDEFINITE FUTURE,
WE TEND TO REGARD IT AS BEING IN UNLIMITED
SUPPLY.
BUT OF THE MILLIONS OF YEARS THAT CONSTITUTE
TIME, THE LENGTH OF IT AVAILABLE TO ANY PERSON
IS LIMITED, AND WILL BE EXHAUSTED LONG BEFORE
THE OIL AND COAL WE ARE SO ANXIOUS TO CONSERVE.
AS A CAR ENGINE LASTS ONLY FOR SO MANY
KILOMETRES, THE HUMAN ORGANISM WEARS OUT AFTER
A GIVEN NUMBER OF YEARS. THEN, FOR THE
INDIVIDUAL CONCERNED, TIME ENDS.
THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO A POET OBSERVED
THAT THE LENGTH OF TIME MOST PEOPLE OF HIS DAY
LIVED WAS ABOUT 70 YEARS: ABOUT 25,500 DAYS.
THAT IS A SMALL TIME SLOT IN THE LONG PERSPECTIVE
OF HISTORY, AND NOT GREATLY EXCEEDED, ON AVERAGE,
TODAY. EVERY 31 DECEMBER MARKS THE END OF AN
ANNUAL INSTALMENT OF A PERSON'S TIME; EVERY
SUNSET CROSSES OFF ANOTHER DAY, AND LEAVES ONE
DAY LESS TO LIVE.
A CHILD EXPECTS HIS TIME SPAN TO LAST TO ITS
FULLEST EXTENT, ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ONE DAY
HE WILL BE AN OLD MAN LIKE GRANDPA. MEDICAL
RESEARCHERS HAVE DONE MUCH TO ENCOURAGE THAT
EXPECTATION. THEY HAVE ERADICATED MOST CAUSES
OF INFANT MORTALITY, CONQUERED OTHER LIFE-
DESTROYING DISEASES, AND FOUND MEANS OF
PROLONGING THE LIVES OF OLDER PEOPLE.
BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY OTHER LIFE-SHORTENING
FACTORS HAVE BEEN CREATED WHICH LEAVE THE
AVERAGE LIFE SPAN MUCH AS IT WAS AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY. PREMATURE DEATH ON
THE ROADS, FOR EXAMPLE, IS ONE SUCH FACTOR.
ALTHOUGH IN THIS STATE ROAD FATALITIES HAVE BEEN
REDUCED BY MEASURES SUCH AS THE .05 ALCOHOL
LEVEL FOR DRIVERS, SPEED LIMITS AND SEAT-BELT
LEGISLATION, EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
NEEDLESSLY DIE IN SMASHES - MOST OF THEM
BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18 AND 25: AN AVERAGE OF
ONLY 7300 DAYS.
THAT EXPENDABLE THING CALLED TIME,
THEREFORE, RUNS OUT SOONER OR LATER, ONE WAY OR
ANOTHER, FOR EVERY ONE OF US.
TO MANY THINKERS IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE
THAT A MAN-MADE OBJECT, SAY A PYRAMID IN
EGYPT, SHOULD ENDURE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS,
WHILE THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED CREATURE WHO PLANS
AND CONSTRUCTS IT SHOULD LAST BUT A FEW THOUSAND
DAYS. IT WOULD BE AN ANTI-CLIMAX WERE HE TO
END IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND OR AS A LITTLE PILE OF
ASHES IN A CREMATORIUM.
TIME, THEY BELIEVE, IS BUT A PRELUDE TO
ETERNITY; DEATH, THE TRANSITION FROM A TIME-
DIMENSION OF BEING INTO A FULLER ONE - A
THOUGHT WORTH REFLECTING ON AS A YEAR OF TIME
PASSES AND WE ENTER ANOTHER.
<F71>
MONDAY 29 DECEMBER 1980
"THE KREMLIN'S DECADE OF CHANGE"
THE SOVIET EMPIRE, STRETCHING FROM THE BERLIN
WALL AND THE KHYBER PASS TO THE BERING
STRAIT, CUTS A FORBIDDING IMAGE IN THE WEST. IT
MUST BE NO LESS FORBIDDING TO THE TINY GROUP OF
OLD RUSSIAN COMMUNISTS WHO HAVE TO RUN IT.
THE VASTNESS OF TERRITORY UNDER THEIR CONTROL
MIGHT SEEM A COMFORT. THAT AND THE RUSSIAN
WINTER HAVE SAVED THE DAY IN THE PAST AND
ENCOURAGED THE BELIEF THAT BORDERS SHOULD BE
PUSHED AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE. TO VIEW THE
WORLD FROM MOSCOW, HOWEVER, AS IT PREPARES
FOR THE 26TH COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS IN
FEBRUARY, IS TO SCAN A FRONTIER THAT IS
FRIGHTENINGLY LONG. ON THE OUTSIDE IS A RING OF
HOSTILITY FROM ALASKA TO GREENLAND AND
CHECKPOINT CHARLIE, FROM THE BOSPORUS AND PARTS
OF THE MIDDLE EAST TO A THOUSAND MILLION
CHINESE AND JAPAN.
CHANGES IN THE STRATEGIC EQUATION AND THE
PROMISE OF AMERICAN ASSERTIVENESS WILL HAVE
RENEWED FEARS OF "CAPITALIST ENCIRCLEMENT", A
NOTION THAT MR KHRUSHCHEV ABANDONED WITH THE
POLICY OF "PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE". THERE IS
OVERWHELMING CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THE KREMLIN
SEES AS THE EMERGENCE OF AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN
THE UNITED STATES, CHINA AND JAPAN, WHICH MAY
HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE REASONS FOR INVADING
AFGHANISTAN A YEAR AGO, TO STRIKE A PATH THROUGH
THE RING. CHINA, ABOVE ALL, IS RESURGENT, AT THE
BEGINNING OF A MILITARY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
WEST NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN FREED FROM MAO'S
ANARCHIC FINAL YEARS. IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE
CAMP DAVID PEACE PROCESS, ALTHOUGH STAGNANT
FOR THE MOMENT, HAS EXCLUDED THE SOVIET UNION.
ABOUT ITS ONLY FRIEND IN THE REGION IS SYRIA, AND
MOSCOW CERTAINLY HAS AS LITTLE CONTROL AS
WASHINGTON OVER IRAN, ITS WAR WITH IRAQ AND
THE REVIVAL OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM.
THE KREMLIN BACKED THE WRONG MAN IN
ZIMBABWE, FINDS ITSELF AT ARM'S LENGTH IN
MOZAMBIQUE AND SEES ANGOLA TURNING INTO MORE
OF AN OBLIGATION THAN AN OPPORTUNITY. CUBA HAS
BECOME A DRAIN. THERE ARE NO FRIENDS IN ASIA
EXCEPT INDIA AND VIETNAM, WHICH DRAW FAR
GREATER BENEFIT FROM THE RELATIONSHIP THAN
MOSCOW. INSIDE THE FRONTIER IS A PANDORA'S BOX
OF NATIONALISMS AND ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS
DIVERSITY HELD TOGETHER IN THE END BY THE
PRESENCE OR PROMISE OF THE SOVIET ARMY, A
WARSAW PACT WHOSE ONLY COMMON GROUND
MIGHT APPEAR TO BE MUTUAL SUSPICION AND
SOMETIMES HATRED, AND GROWING POCKETS OF
DISSIDENCE AND DISENCHANTMENT. IT IS A PICTURE
OF VULNERABILITY. IN THE MIDDLE ARE THE MEN OF
THE KREMLIN, ISOLATED BY PRIVILEGE, TRAPPED WITH
A DISCREDITED AND UNWORKABLE IDEOLOGY, ISSUING
ORDERS TO AN INFLEXIBLE, UNPRODUCTIVE AND
WASTEFUL SYSTEM AND DEVOTING MUCH TIME TO
KEEPING THEIR JOBS AND THE MULTITUDE OF FRINGE
BENEFITS THAT DO NOT FOLLOW INTO RETIREMENT.
UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO, THESE LEADERS WHO
CAME TO HIGH OFFICE AFTER THE PURGES OF THE LATE
1930S HAD TO WORRY ABOUT HOLDING ON TO THEIR
LIVES AS WELL. THEY ARE INSECURE TO THEIR BONES.
SO THEY PAMPER THE SECURITY FORCES WITH A
BURDENSOME 14 PER CENT OF THE SOVIET GROSS
NATIONAL PRODUCT (THE UNITED STATES SPENDS 5
PER CENT), LIMP FROM ONE FAILED FIVE-YEAR PLAN
TO ANOTHER, SACRIFICE EACH OTHER AS SCAPEGOATS
AND DRAFT SOME OF THEIR BEST BRAINS TO PRESERVE
THE MYTH OF THE MARXIST-LENINIST MONOLITH. IF
THE WEST'S ECONOMIC CONDITION IS PARLOUS, THERE
IS A CREEPING CRISIS DOWN ON THE SOVIET FARM,
IN THE SOVIET FACTORY AND ON THE SOVIET OILFIELD.
THE KREMLIN'S OWN FIGURES SUGGEST THAT ANOTHER
AGRICULTURAL DISASTER IS IN THE MAKING. THE
ECONOMY GIVES EVERY INDICATION OF WORSENING,
INCREASING THE DANGER OF DOMESTIC DISSENT IN THE
YEARS AHEAD. THE WORLD'S BIGGEST OIL PRODUCER
FACES THE NEED TO IMPORT ENERGY.
ON THE WHOLE IT IS A PICTURE OF A SOVIET
UNION WHICH, DESPITE MASSIVE RESOURCES, FEELS
INSECURE AND RELATIVELY UNSUCCESSFUL IN EVERY
SPHERE EXCEPT THE MILITARY, AND EVEN THAT MAY
BE IN DOUBT AFTER AFGHANISTAN. BUT THE LEADERS,
WHILE THEY ARE VISIBLY CONCERNED AND TINKER WITH
MODEST REFORMS, SHOW NO SIGN OF WILLINGNESS TO
ADOPT THE DRASTIC MEASURES THAT ARE PROBABLY
NECESSARY. THEIR AVERAGE AGE IS 70. MANY OF
THEM ARE AILING. PRESIDENT BREZHNEV, THE SICKEST
OF THEM ALL THESE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, NONETHELESS
IS STILL CONSOLIDATING HIS HOLD ON POWER. OVER
THE 17 YEARS OF HIS LEADERSHIP HE HAS GRADUALLY
AND THOROUGHLY ELIMINATED ALL THE PODGORNYS
AND POLYANSKYS, THE MAZUROVS AND KOSYGINS
WHO WERE HIS CHIEF RIVALS. HE HAS CAREFULLY AND
SUCCESSFULLY SOUGHT THE DEMOTION OF VIRTUALLY
EVERY YOUNG BULL WHO MIGHT THROWUP A
CHALLENGE OR BE QUALIFIED TO SUCCEED HIM. NEARLY
ALL THE MOST LIKELY SUCCESSORS HAVE BEEN DENIED
FULL MEMBERSHIP OF THE POLITBURO.
THE MAN WHO COBBLED TOGETHER A COALITION
TO OUST MR KHRUSHCHEV - MR BREZHNEV'S PATRON
 - HAS NOT PERMITTED SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES TO
DEVELOP AROUND HIMSELF. INSTEAD THE SOVIET
UNION HAS AN ENTRENCHED GERONTOCRACY THAT WILL
TAKE ANOTHER FIVE OR SIX YEARS TO DIE OFF OR BE
DISGRACED. MR BREZHNEV HIMSELF, ALTHOUGH HE HAS
LOOKED HEALTHIER OF LATE, COULD DIE OR FIND HIMSELF
UNABLE TO CONTINUE WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO, WHICH
WOULD MEAN AN INTERIM MAN AT THE TOP BEFORE
THE NEW GENERATION COULD MOVE IN. IT IS
DOUBTFUL THAT ANY INNOVATIVE REFORMS WILL COME
BEFORE A SPRING CLEAN IN THE KREMLIN, AND EVEN
THEN THE NEXT GENERATION, ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE
EAGER TO INTRODUCE POLICY SHIFTS, MAY FIND ITSELF
A PRISONER OF THE SYSTEM.
THE HEIR-APPARENTS ARE MUCH YOUNGER THAN
THE MEN THEY ARE WAITING TO REPLACE. THEY WERE
BORN AFTER THE REVOLUTION, WERE CHILDREN DURING
THE GREAT PURGES THAT MAY HAVE CARRIED OFF THEIR
PARENTS, AND FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II AS
TEENAGERS. THEY STARTED THEIR RISE TO THE TOP
AFTER MR KHRUSHCHEV HAD CONFIRMED HIS POSITION
IN THE LATE 1950S. THEY ARE AT HOME WITH THE
CONCEPT OF THE SOVIET UNION AS A SUPERPOWER.
CERTAINLY THE MEMBERS OF THE NEW GENERATION
ARE BETTER EDUCATED. THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE AND
TECHNICAL TRAINING HAS BEEN SUPERIOR.
INTERNATIONALLY THEY WILL BE MORE AT EASE AND
IDEOLOGICALLY WILL FEEL LESS INHIBITED. THEY ARE
THE PRODUCTS OF UTTERLY DIFFERENT TIMES AND THIS
WILL BE REFLECTED IN THEIR ATTITUDES. PERHAPS
THERE WILL BE A BOLD STREAK, EVEN A TASTE FOR
FOREIGN ADVENTURES AND A DARING IN THE FACE OF
DAUNTING AND DEMANDING PROBLEMS. BUT FIRST
THERE ARE A FEW YEARS LEFT TO THE OLD
REACTIONARIES, TRYING TO MUDDLE THROUGH ON THE
STATUS QUO AND WITH NO COHERENT ANSWER  TO
MOSCOW'S BIGGEST QUESTION: HOW TO AFFORD THE
ARMS RACE AND AT THE SAME TIME A BETTER
STANDARD OF LIVING FOR THE PROLETARIAT.

TUESDAY 30 DECEMBER 1980
"SETBACK FOR THE OPERA"
ALL GOING WELL, 1981 WAS TO HAVE BEEN A BIG
YEAR FOR MUSIC IN VICTORIA AND FOR OPERA IN
MELBOURNE. THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAD
DESIGNATED IT AS MUSIC YEAR, AND AS PART OF IT
THE VICTORIA STATE OPERA WAS TO HAVE JOINED
FORCES WITH THE AUSTRALIAN OPERA IN PRESENTING
A 15-OPERA SEASON. FOUR OF THE OPERAS WERE TO
HAVE BEEN MOUNTED BY THE VSO AND 11 BY THE
NATIONAL COMPANY. ON PAPER IT LOOKED AN
EXCITING PROSPECT: A FORTASTE OF THINGS TO COME
ONCE THE VICTORIAN ARTS CENTRE IS FINISHED AND
THE 2000-SEAT OPERA-BALLET HALL OPENS ITS DOORS
FOR BUSINESS.
BUT SUDDENLY THE PLANS HAVE GONE SOUR.
MUSIC YEAR HAS BEEN DEFERRED UNTIL 1982, WHILE
THE VSO HAS HAD A NASTY FINANCIAL SHOCK.
INSTEAD OF THE $385,000 WHICH THE COMPANY HAD
REQUESTED FROM THE AUSTRALIA COUNCIL TO
FINANCE ITS 1981 PROGRAMME, IT HAS BEEN GIVEN
ONLY $45,000 - THE SAME AS FOR THE PRESENT
YEAR. AS A RESULT THE COMPANY'S PLANS HAVE BEEN
THROWN INTO TURMOIL. CONFIDENT OF GETTING THE
MONEY, THE VSO HAD GONE AHEAD AND CONTRACTED
ARTISTS, ANNOUNCED ITS SEASONS AND BEGUN
SELLING TICKETS. BECAUSE OF THE SHORTFALL, THE
COMPANY IS NOW FACED WITH THE UNPALATABLE
PROSPECT OF HAVING TO TRIM ITS 1981 PROGRAMME
OR CANCEL IT COMPLETELY. CONTRACTS MAY HAVE TO
BE TERMINATED AND TICKET MONEY REFUNDED. NONE
OF THIS WOULD HELP THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION,
NOR ENDEAR IT TO ITS FAST-GROWING MELBOURNE
AUDIENCE.
THE VILLAIN OF THIS PARTICULAR OPERATIC PIECE
IS NOT EASY TO PIN DOWN. PERHAPS THE VSO WAS
NAIVE IN THINKING THAT IT WOULD GET THE MONEY
IT HAD ASKED FOR. PERHAPS IT UNDERESTIMATED THE
POWER OF THE AUSTRALIAN OPERA LOBBYISTS WHO
HAVE BEEN HARD AT WORK FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS
TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE REPORT ON THE FUTURE OF
OPERA IN AUSTRALIA, COMMISSIONED BY THE
AUSTRALIA COUNCIL AND CARRIED OUT BY DR KEN
MCKINNON. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS REPORT
RECOMMENDED THAT WHILE THE AO SHOULD
REMAIN THE NATIONAL COMPANY, IT SHOULD SPEND
MORE OF ITS TIME IN SYDNEY AND LESS TIME TOURING
INTERSTATE. IT ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT OVER THE
NEXT FIVE YEARS THE VSO SHOULD BE BUILT UP
PROGRESSIVELY TO THE POINT WHERE IT BECAME AN
ALL-YEAR-ROUND ENSEMBLE. IN THE BELIEF THAT THE
MCKINNON REPORT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE VSO APPARENTLY WENT
AHEAD AND MADE ITS PLANS FOR NEXT YEAR.
THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY'S 1981 SEASON
NOW RESTS UPON A MEETING OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE AUSTRALIA COUNCIL AND THE VICTORIAN
MINISTRY FOR THE ARTS ON 6 JANUARY. BETWEEN
THEM THEY MAY FIND A WAY OUT OF THE VSO'S
CURRENT DIFFICULTIES. WE HOPE THEY CAN. CLEARLY,
THE AFFAIR POINTS UP THE NEED FOR ALL SUBSIDISED
COMPANIES (THEATRICAL AS WELL AS OPERATIC) TO
KNOW WELL IN ADVANCE WHAT THEIR FUNDING FOR THE
YEAR AHEAD WILL BE. IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST STOP BEING EVASIVE AND
DECIDE WHETHER TO CARRY OUT THE
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MCKINNON REPORT OR NOT.
UNTIL IT DOES, NEITHER THE VSO NOR THE NATIONAL
COMPANY CAN PLAN AHEAD WITH ANY CONFIDENCE.
"A MISUSE OF OUR MONEY"
ALL GOVERNMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME SPEND
TAXPAYERS' MONEY ON MEDIA ADVERTISING TO
PUBLICISE GOVERNMENT SERVICES OR TO PASS ON
INFORMATION THAT IS IMPORTANT TO US. SINCE THE
PUBLIC ITSELF IS THE BENEFICIARY OF THIS ADVERTISING,
IT IS A LEGITIMATE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS AND NO
REASONABLE PERSON WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.
IT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT MATTER, HOWEVER,
WHEN OUR TAX MONEY IS USED FOR MEDIA
ADVERTISING DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THE RULING PARTY
ITSELF. THE HAMER GOVERNMENT'S PRESENT
ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN ON TV, RADIO AND IN THE
PRESS TO PROMOTE ITS "NEW DIRECTIONS FOR
VICTORIA" IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE. ITS SOLE PURPOSE
IS TO PUBLICISE LIBERAL PARTY POLICIES  - AND
MINISTERS - AND TO SELL THEM TO THE VOTERS IN
AN ATTRACTIVE PACKAGE. THIS PARTISAN PIECE OF
SELF-PROMOTION WILL COST VICTORIAN TAXPAYERS
$160,000. AT THE SAME TIME THE HAMER GOVERN-
MENT IS CUTTING OFF FUNDS TO GROUPS ASSISTING
LOW-INCOME TENANTS AND PEOPLE SEEKING LODGING.
IT IS DOING SO ON THE GROUNDS OF REDUCING
WASTEFUL GOVERNMENT SPENDING.
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR SUCH A BLATANT
MISUSE OF TAXPAYERS' MONEY. THE ADVERTISING
CAMPAIGN IS OF NO VALUE TO THE PUBLIC; THE ONLY
INTERESTS IT SERVES ARE THOSE OF THE LIBERAL
PARTY. THE VICTORIAN BRANCH OF THE LIBERALS
SHOULD OFFER IMMEDIATELY TO REIMBURSE THE STATE
TREASURY FOR THE WHOLE COSTS OF THE CAMPAIGN
- SO THAT GOVERNMENT FUNDS CAN BE SPENT
WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED.
"OUR EMPTY MAIL BOXES"
AFTER THE LONG CHRISTMAS BREAK, MANY OF US
YESTERDAY WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING
THE MAIL. BUSINESS WAS BACK AT WORK FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN FIVE DAYS; PEOPLE AT HOME WERE
HOPING FOR A WORD FROM FRIENDS. WE WERE ALL
DISAPPOINTED. THERE WAS NO MAIL FOR ANYONE
BECAUSE THE WORKERS OF AUSTRALIA POST WERE
ENJOYING AN EXTRA DAY'S HOLIDAY.
OTHER COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVANTS WERE
ENJOYING THE EXTRA DAY OFF AS WELL AS THE POSTAL
WORKERS. BUT SUCH AN INDULGENCE SHOULD NOT BE
ALLOWED TO DEPRIVE THE PUBLIC OF A SERVICE AS
IMPORTANT AS THE POST. SIX DAYS BETWEEN MAIL
DELIVERIES IS FAR TOO LONG, AND THE QUEUES FOR
STAMPS AT THE TELECOM COUNTERS AT THE GPO
YESTERDAY WERE TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT THE
WORKING PUBLIC NEEDS A WORKING POSTAL SERVICE.
WHY SHOULD FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVANTS HAVE
AN EXTRA HOLIDAY OF THEIR OWN WHEN, LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE, THEY WOULD ALREADY HAVE NINE
DAYS OFF IN THE 16 DAYS FROM 20 DECEMBER TO
4 JANUARY? OUR EMPTY MAIL BOXES YESTERDAY
SHOULD DRAW ATTENTION TO THE NEED TO BRING THE
WORK BENEFITS OF PUBLIC SERVANTS - SUCH AS
HOLIDAYS AND SUPERANNUATION - BACK INTO LINE
WITH THOSE OF THE PUBLIC WHICH PAYS FOR THEM.
<F73>
FRIDAY 2 JANUARY 1981
"THE STRUGGLE IN EL SALVADOR"
THE RESURGENCE OF VIOLENCE AND TURMOIL IN
CENTRAL AMERICA WILL PROVIDE ONE OF
PRESIDENT REAGAN'S FIRST FOREIGN POLICY TESTS.
SOME OF THE MORE CONSERVATIVE IN WASHINGTON
SEEK A RETURN TO THE SIMPLE DAYS OF REWARDING
WITHOUT QUESTION AMERICA'S FRIENDS ON THE
ISTHMUS, IN OTHER WORDS, ANY REGIME THAT IS ANTI-
COMMUNIST. THERE ARE EVEN SUGGESTIONS OF A
RETURN TO GREEN BERET DIPLOMACY. PRESIDENT
CARTER TRIED PRAGMATISM, THEY ARGUE, AND LOOK
WHERE THAT LED.
IT IS TRUE THAT THE CARTER POLICY WAS OPEN TO
CHARGES OF MISJUDGMENT, INEPTNESS AND
INCONSISTENCY. BUT HOWEVER HARSHLY HE MAY BE
JUDGED, MR CARTER HAD HIS HEART IN THE RIGHT
PLACE. HIS STATE DEPARTMENT AT LEAST TRIED TO
COME TO TERMS WITH THE FORCES OF CHANGE IN
CENTRAL AMERICA. THE SIX TINY NATIONS BECAME A
LABORATORY FOR DEALING WITH THIRD WORLD CHANGE
IN GENERAL. MR CARTER'S EXPERIMENTS WITH HUMAN
RIGHTS AND RADICAL ELEMENTS WERE SINGLED OUT BY
MR REAGAN DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN AS AN
EXERCISE IN FUTILITY AND A DESERTION
OF TRADITIONALLY DEPENDABLE AMERICAN ALLIES.
AT NO TIME WERE THE CRIES LOUDER THAN WHEN
AID TO THE CIVILIAN-MILITARY JUNTA IN EL SALVADOR
WAS SUSPENDED A MONTH AGO AFTER THE RAPE AND
MURDER OF FOUR NORTH AMERICAN MISSIONARIES.
THEIR DEATHS FOLLOWED THE KILLING OF NEARLY
10,000 SALVADORIANS IN A YEAR AND UNDERLINED
STRONG SUSPICIONS THAT THE JUNTA WAS UNWILLING OR
UNABLE TO CONTROL THE REPRESSIVE POLICE FORCE AND
ARMY. THE WITHHOLDING OF AID WAS DESIGNED TO
STRENGTHEN THE MODERATE AND REFORMIST MEMBERS
OF THE JUNTA IN THE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD THEN
GAIN THE UPPER HAND AGAINST THE RIGHT-WINGERS.
IT WAS A FINE GESTURE IN THEORY. UNHAPPILY,
HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO MODERATES OF ANY
SIGNIFICANCE LEFT IN EL SALVADOR. THE REFORMISTS
HAVE BEEN KILLED, SILENCED OR FORCED OUT OF THE
COUNTRY. THERE IS NO TRUE POLITICAL CENTRE AND ONE
CANNOT BE CREATED BY WELL-MEANING OUTSIDERS. THE
COUNTRY MAY HAVE A NEW CIVILIAN PRESIDENT BUT
THE DECISIONS ARE STILL MADE BY RIGHT-WING
MILITARY OFFICERS.
YET TO SEE THE STRUGGLE IN EL SALVADOR, OR
ANYWHERE ELSE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, PURELY IN
TERMS OF LEFT-RIGHT CONFLICT WOULD BE INACCURATE.
IT IS A WAR BETWEEN THE LAND OWNERS, THE
INDUSTRIALISTS AND THE ARMY ON THE ONE HAND AND
THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION, THE
PEASANTS, ON THE OTHER. THOSE WITH THE MONEY
AND PROPERTY, TERRIFIED OF BEING DISPOSSESSED, ARE
IN ALLIANCE WITH THOSE WHO CONTROL THE SECURITY
FORCES AND CERTAINLY ARE NOT HESITANT ABOUT USING
THEM. THE VICTIMS ARE THE PEASANTS, CONDEMNED
TO THE DESPERATE POVERTY OF A FEUDAL SYSTEM AND
FORCED THROUGH CRUELTY TO ACQUIESCE OR SEEK
VIOLENT CHANGE.
THOSE IN WASHINGTON WHO ARGUE THAT THE
ONLY WAY OF STEMMING CUBA'S GROWING INFLUENCE
IS TO RE-ESTABLISH CLOSE TIES WITH THE REGION'S
MILITARY-DOMINATED REGIMES SEEM TO FORGET ONE
IMPORTANT THING. THEY ARE PROPOSING TO
PERPETUATE THE VERY CONDITIONS THAT BROUGHT
ABOUT THE LEFTIST REBELLIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT
IS AS HARD TO BLAME THOSE WHO CHOOSE ARMED
REVOLUTION IN CENTRAL AMERICA AS IT IS TO CONVINCE
THEM THAT COMMUNISM IS FULL OF EMPTY PROMISES.
IN MANY CASES THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT WITH NO
CHOICE. AT HOME THEY SEE DICTATORSHIP AND
CORRUPTION AT THE TOP AND SEETHING POVERTY AND
BACKWARDNESS AT THE BOTTOM. ABROAD THEY SEE
THE END OF A CARTER ADMINISTRATION THAT TRIED TO
HELP AND FAILED. ABOVE ALL, THEY SEE A PRESIDENT-
ELECT REAGAN, WHOSE OVERWHELMING CONCERN
ABOUT THE AMBITIONS OF DR CASTRO MAY LEAD HIM
INTO AN UNCRITICAL EMBRACE OF MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP AND OPPRESSION. SUCH SUPPORT WOULD
INCREASE THE APPEAL OF THE LEFTISTS AND SPEED
THEIR VICTORY.
"TIME TO ABOLISH BRITISH HONORS"
THIS YEAR'S NEW YEAR HONORS LIST HAD
BARELY BEEN ANNOUNCED BEFORE THE GREEK
COMMUNITY WAS REGISTERING A PROTEST. THEIR
COMPLAINT IS THAT PEOPLE WITH AN ETHNIC
BACKGROUND ARE HARDLY EVER HONORED. THE GREEK
COMMUNITY HAS A POINT. THE HONORS DISHED OUT
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND BY THE FOUR
NON-LABOR STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE NARROWLY
REPRESENTATIVE. ALL TOO OFTEN THEY ARE A THINLY
DISGUISED REWARD FOR SERVICE TO THE RULING PARTY.
MOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE AN HONORS SYSTEM
WHICH RECOGNISES DISTINGUISHED SERVICE. THIS IS
FAIR ENOUGH WHEN THE AWARDS ARE MADE BY AN
INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE AND NOT BY THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY. THE ORDER OF AUSTRALIA,
WHICH THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED,
FOLLOWS THIS PATTERN. BUT THE IMPERIAL HONORS
ARE STILL VERY MUCH THE PREROGATIVE OF THE PRIME
MINISTER AND THE PREMIERS. FEW ARE MADE AT
THE DIRECT INSTIGATION OF THE QUEEN. MOST FOLLOW
RECOMMENDATIONS MADE AT THIS END BY GOVERN-
MENTS AND THEIR ADVISERS. ALL TOO OFTEN THEY
ABUSE THEIR POSITION OF PATRONAGE, DEBASING THE
AWARDS IN THE PROCESS.
THE WAY ROUND THE PROBLEM IS TO ABOLISH
THE ANACHRONISTIC BRITISH HONORS AND TO REPLACE
THEM WITH AN HONORS SYSTEM WHICH IS AUSTRALIAN
IN CHARACTER AND WHICH REWARDS GENUINE
ACHIEVEMENT OR PUBLIC SERVICE. WHAT IS NEEDED
IS A SYSTEM TO REGAIN THE RESPECT OF THE
COMMUNITY, NOT ONE WHICH HAS BEEN CHEAPENED
OVER THE YEARS AND WHICH IS NOW THE BUTT OF
JOKES AND CYNICAL COMMENT.
<F74>
SATURDAY 3 JANUARY 1981
"CHANGE AT THE TOP IN CHINA"
FOR HUA GUOFENG, CHINA'S COMMUNIST PARTY
CHAIRMAN AND UNTIL RECENTLY PRIME MINISTER
AS WELL, IT HAS BEEN A SLOW POLITICAL DEATH WHICH
CAME QUICKLY AT THE END. IT NOW REMAINS FOR A
MEETING OF THE PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE, TO BE
HELD SOON, TO "ACCEPT" MR HUA'S RESIGNATION AND
DECIDE ON A SUCCESSOR, EXPECTED TO BE MR HU
YAOBANG, THE PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY. IN A VERY
CHINESE WAY, THE LEADERSHIP CHOSE A NEW YEAR'S
DAY TEA PARTY TO DROP THE BROADEST HINT YET THAT
THE UNFORTUNATE MR HUA WAS DOWN, IF NOT OUT
ALTOGETHER. MR HUA'S ABSENCE FROM THIS
TRADITIONAL GATHERING OF THE PARTY LEADERSHIP WAS
AS EXTRAORDINARY AS IT WAS POINTED. IT CAME
AFTER WEEKS OF INTENSE SPECULATION IN THE CHINESE
CAPITAL THAT THE MAN ANOINTED BY MAO TSETUNG
ON HIS DEATHBED WAS ON THE WAY OUT.
HOW FAR MR HUA HAS FALLEN WILL NOT BE
REVEALED UNTIL AFTER THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HAS
DEALT WITH THE PROBLEM OF SUCCESSION. THE
REASONS FOR HIS DEPARTURE AFTER A LITTLE MORE THAN
FOUR YEARS IN THE JOB MAY BE DEALT WITH ONLY
SKETCHILY IN PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE PARTY
CENTRE. THE SIMPLE EXPLANATION APPEARS TO BE
THAT MR HUA IS THE LOSER IN A POWER STRUGGLE IN
THE HIGHER REACHES OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST
PARTY, A STRUGGLE WHICH HAS SEEN THE DENGIST
FACTION TIGHTEN ITS GRIP ON LEADING POSITIONS.
DENG XIAOPING, A VICE-CHAIRMAN, NOMINALLY
NUMBER THREE IN THE HIERARCHY, IS ACKNOWLEDGED
AS THE MOST POWERFUL FIGURE IN THE LEADERSHIP.
IF HIS LONG-TERM STRATEGY WHEN HE BEGAN
REASSERTING HIS INFLUENCE IN 1978 WAS TO GET HIS
OWN MEN INTO POSITIONS OF POWER, THEN HE
APPEARS TO BE WITHIN REACH OF ACHIEVING HIS
OBJECTIVE. IN MID-1980, MR DENG HELPED ENGINEER
MR HUA'S "RESIGNATION" FROM THE PRIME
MINISTERSHIP, A POSITION HE HELD FROM CHOU
EN-LAI'S DEATH IN 1976. HAVING ACHIEVED THAT
WEAKENING OF THE HUAIST POSITION, THE DENGISTS
THEN SET ABOUT WRESTLING THE CHAIRMANSHIP FROM
HIM. THIS CAMPAIGN, EMBARRASSINGLY POINTED AT
TIMES, WAS CARRIED THROUGH THE PAGES OF THE
'PEOPLE'S DAILY', PRODUCING THE EXTRAORDINARY
SPECTACLE OF THE PARTY LEADER BEING SNIPED AT
FROM THE COLUMNS OF THE PARTY NEWSPAPER. IT HAS
BEEN OBVIOUS FROM THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR THAT
A QUITE INTENSE CAMPAIGN AIMED AT MR HUA HAS
BEEN IN PROGRESS. ITS ULTIMATE AIM: TO TOPPLE HIM
FROM THE CHAIRMANSHIP.
IF THERE IS A SURPRISE IN THE WAY THINGS HAVE
TURNED OUT, IT IS THAT THE END HAS COME QUICKER
AND LESS GRACEFULLY THAN EXPECTED. WHY THIS
SHOULD BE SO IS A QUESTION THAT MAY NEVER BE
ANSWERED SATISFACTORILY, BUT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY
CONNECTED IN SOME WAY WITH THE GANG OF FOUR
TRIAL NOW IN ITS LAST STAGES AND WITH THE
ACCELERATED PROCESS OF "DE-MAOISATION" WHICH
WAS A FEATURE OF THE CHINESE POLITICAL SCENE
THROUGH THE SECOND HALF OF 1980. THE HAPLESS
MR HUA, DEVOTED FOLLOWER OF MAO, WHO GOT WHERE
HE DID BECAUSE OF THE GREAT HELMSMAN'S
PATRONAGE, IS PARTLY A CASUALTY OF THE DIMINISHED
MAOIST REPUTATION.
WHAT NOW FOR THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP AFTER
AN APPARENTLY BRUISING EXPERIENCE? WILL IT
SUCCESSFULLY REFORM AND REGROUP TO CAPTURE THE
UNITY AND STABILITY WHICH ELUDED IT THROUGH LAST
YEAR? A LESSON IN ALL THIS, PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE
WHO WERE INSISTING THROUGH 1980 THAT TALK OF
TENSION IN THE LEADERSHIP WAS EXAGGERATED, IS
THAT FACTIONALISM IS ALMOST NEVER ABSENT FROM
CHINESE POLITICS. ONE FACTION APPEARS TO HAVE
WON.
THE TEST FOR THE DENGISTS WILL BE HOW WELL
THEY DEAL WITH CHINA'S IMMENSE ECONOMIC
DIFFICULTIES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME INJECTING
SOME VITALITY INTO THE CHINESE COMMUNITY PARTY,
WHICH DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE IN VERY GOOD
SHAPE. HAVING SECURED THE TOP POSITIONS IN THE
PARTY AND THE STATE, THEIR POLICIES MAY BE
FRUSTRATED IN THE MIDDLE AND LOWER REACHES OF
THE PARTY AND THE BUREAUCRACY, HOME, NO DOUBT,
OF MANY SYMPATHETIC TO MR HUA. MR DENG
HIMSELF MAY NOT HAVE WON MANY FRIENDS OUTSIDE
THE LEADERSHIP GROUP BY THE APPARENTLY QUITE
RUTHLESS FASHION IN WHICH HE WENT ABOUT GETTING
RID OF HUA GUOFENG. THIS MAY BE A SOURCE OF
CONTINUING IRRITATION IN PARTY RANKS.
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
CHRISTMAS IS PAST, THE INAPPROPRIATE MEAL
DIGESTED, AND IT IS TO BE HOPED THE
CHRISTIAN MESSAGE EQUALLY READ, MARKED AND
LEARNED FOR USE IN THE NEW YEAR.
THIS IS MORE DIFFICULT TO DO IN THE SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE. IN THE NORTHERN IT IS DRAMATICALLY
ILLUSTRATED BY THE SHORT DAYS AND EARLY DARKNESS,
BY THE FROZEN GROUND BARREN TO THE EYE AND BY
THE GAUNT AND LEAFLESS TREES.
WITH SO MANY MONTHS TO WAIT FOR SPRING,
THE BARRENNESS OF LIFE AND THE NEED FOR THE
REASSURANCE OF HOPE CAN BE FELT INTENSELY. THE
EARLY CHURCH WAS WISE TO TIE THE EXPRESSION
OF ITS NEW TRUTHS TO THE ANCIENT MYTHS OF
NATURE.
THE MESSAGE OF SALVATION BY MEANS OF THE
BIRTH OF THE CHRIST CHILD INTO THE WORLD CAN
MEAN LITTLE WITHOUT THE ACCEPTANCE FIRST OF MAN'S
NEED; AND MAN'S NEED IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF
HIS FALL. THIS CONCEPT IS COMMON TO ALMOST ALL
THE ANCIENT MYTHOLOGIES AND THE STORY IN
GENESIS IS NOT EVEN JEWISH BUT COMES FROM
BABYLON OR FARTHER EAST.
MANKIND MUST VERY EARLY HAVE BECOME
CONSCIOUS OF THE PREDICAMENT EXPRESSED MUCH
LATER IN NEAR DESPAIR BY ST PAUL "FOR THE GOOD
THAT I WOULD I DO NOT; BUT THE EVIL WHICH I
WOULD NOT THAT I DO".
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF GOOD AND EVIL IS THE
FRUIT OF THAT FORBIDDEN TREE AND THE REPEATED
EMERGENCE OF THIS STORY OR SOMETHING LIKE IT IS
EVIDENCE OF HOW EARLY MAN'S CONSCIENCE
BECAME AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS IT PRESENTS.
FOR MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS, AND MORE
PARTICULARLY SINCE THE PURITAN REVOLUTIONS, THIS
IDEA OF ORIGINAL SIN WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SEX,
AND MUCH TRAGEDY HAS FLOWED FROM THE ERROR.
THE REAL AND BASIC SIN FROM WHICH MAN NEEDS
TO BE SAVED IS NOT SEX, WHICH IS AT LEAST MUTUAL,
BUT SELFISHNESS.
TO ALL MEN AND WOMEN, UNREGENERATE-THAT
IS, NOT BORN AGAIN - SELFISHNESS IS THE NATIVE AND
MOST DESTRUCTIVE OF ALL TEMPTATIONS. AMONG THE
PRIMITIVE SOCIETIES DISCOVERED BY EARLY TRAVELLERS,
IN THOSE THAT SEEMED MOST LIKE THE GARDEN OF
EDEN MEN AND WOMEN LIVED TOGETHER IN HARMONY
AND THE SOCIETY HELD ALL THEIR GOODS IN COMMON
AND FOR THE COMMON GOOD. THE ARRIVAL OF THE
WEST UPON THEM BROUGHT NOT ONLY MEASLES AND
TUBERCULOSIS, IT ALSO BROUGHT SELF-SEEKING AND THE
JOYS AND PAINS OF COMPETITIVE GREED.
HERE THEN WE ACCEPT SELFISHNESS AS MAN'S
ORIGINAL SIN, AND YET LIVE DEVOTED TO A FREE
ENTERPRISE SOCIETY BASED LARGELY ON MOTIVES OF
PROFIT MAKING AND SELF-AGGRANDISEMENT. IS THIS
A GROSS HYPROCRISY OR ARE THE TWO CONCEPTS
COMPATIBLE?
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT CONCERNING THE
ADVANTAGES WHICH FREE ENTERPRISE HAS BROUGHT
TO WESTERN SOCIETY, AND THERE IS CONSIDERABLE
DOUBT FROM THE EVIDENCE OF RUSSIA AS TO WHETHER
ANY OTHER ECONOMIC SOCIETY CAN PROSPER TO THE
ADVANTAGE OF ITS CITIZENS. THERE IS NO DOUBT
ALSO THAT IN THE PAST THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM
HAS FLOURISHED AT THE COST OF MONSTROUS
INJUSTICE TO ITS WEAKER MEMBERS.
WE ARE, EVEN NOW, BEING CONSTANTLY TOLD
THAT THE RICH NATIONS ARE BECOMING RICHER AND
THE POOR POORER, AND THAT THIS IS HAPPENING
EVEN IN OUR OWN SO FORTUNATE COUNTRY. NO OTHER
METHOD PRESENTS US WITH ANY PROMISE OF A
GREATER SUCCESS.
THIS THEN IS THE DILEMMA. THIS IS THE PROBLEM
WHICH WE SHOULD SET OUT TO SOLVE IN THE NEW
YEAR. A SPURIOUSLY SOPHISTICATED SOCIETY SUCH
AS OURS IS UNLIKELY TO FIND MUCH INSPIRATION
FROM THE STORY OF ADAM AND EVE. IS IT ANY
MORE LIKELY TO FIND IT FROM CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE?
AND WHAT HAS CHRISTIAN TEACHING TO SAY ON THIS
PARTICULAR POINT?
CHRIST WAS NOT A POLITICAL REVOLUTIONARY. IF HE
HAD BEEN, HE WOULD SURELY HAVE OPENLY
CONDEMNED SLAVERY, AN INSTITUTION UNIVERSALLY
ACCEPTED IN HIS DAY. HE DID NOT, BUT IT FOLLOWED
FROM HIS TEACHING THAT SLAVES WERE HUMAN
BEINGS TO BE RESPECTED AND LOVED WITHOUT
CONSIDERATION OF THEIR STATION. THE SAME LOVE
INCLUDED SOLDIERS, PUBLICANS AND PROSTITUTES. HE
ACCEPTED THE INSTITUTIONS OF HIS DAY; HIS PURPOSE
WAS TO TRANSMUTE THEM INTO VEHICLES BY MEANS
OF WHICH HIS LOVE OF HUMANITY COULD BE
EXTENDED. IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK OF THE FREE
ENTERPRISE SOCIETY?
SEEING ITS ADVANTAGES AND ITS POTENTIAL, WE
SHOULD ALSO RECOGNISE ITS DANGERS AND ITS
TEMPTATIONS. USING, AS IT HAS TO DO, ONE OF MAN'S
BASIC CHARACTERISTICS, HIS SELF-INTEREST, IT MUST
BE TRANSMUTED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO USE ANOTHER
CHARACTERISTIC: HIS CAPACITY FOR RESPONSIBILITY, FOR
COMPASSION AND FOR JUSTICE. IT MUST RECOGNISE
THAT WITHOUT THE OPERATION OF THESE BY THE
STRONG, THE WEAKER WILL GO TO THE WALL, WHETHER
IN OUR OWN COUNTRY OR IN THE STILL UNDEVELOPED
WORLD.
THAT IS A PURPOSE WORTH THINKING ABOUT IN
THE NEW YEAR. THIS IS WHERE HOPE LIES IN SPITE
OF THE DARKNESS.
<F75>
MONDAY 5 JANUARY 1981
"CITY COUNCIL SLANGING MATCH"
NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S
DECISION TO SACK THE MELBOURNE CITY COUNCIL
AND TO REPLACE IT WITH AN INTERIM ADMINISTRATION
HAS TRIGGERED OFF AN ANGRY RESPONSE FROM
COUNCILLORS. THE LORD MAYOR, COUNCILLOR
WOODRUFF, HAS EXPRESSED QUALIFIED SUPPORT FOR
THE RESTRUCTURING. BUT HIS VIEW IS NOT SHARED BY
MANY OF HIS FELLOW COUNCILLORS. COUNCILLOR IRVIN
ROCKMAN, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS ENGAGED IN A PUBLIC
SLANGING MATCH WITH THE PREMIER, MR HAMER,
ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT OF DOING WHAT IT DID IN
ORDER TO BOLSTER ITS OWN IMAGE AND APPEAR
FORCEFUL AND RESPONSIBLE; WHILE COUNCILLOR LINTON
LETHLEAN HAS DESCRIBED THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION
AS "A CHEAP POLITICAL TRICK". SYSTEMATIC EFFORTS
HAVE BEEN MADE TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT,
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME EMPHASISING WHAT THE
COUNCILLORS SEE AS THE COUNCIL'S REAL AND POSITIVE
ACHIEVEMENTS.
IN THIS CONTEXT TWO MOVES WILL BE DISCUSSED
- AND PROBABLY APPROVED - AT TODAY'S SPECIAL
MEETING OF THE COUNCIL. ONE IS A REFERENDUM OF
RATEPAYERS ON THE QUESTION OF RESTRUCTURING. THE
OTHER IS A COUNCIL-FUNDED CAMPAIGN DESIGNED TO
PUT THE COUNCIL IN A BETTER PUBLIC LIGHT. THE
ATTITUDE OF THE CITY'S RATEPAYERS TO THE
GOVERNMENT'S MOVE IS HARD TO GAUGE, ALTHOUGH
RESIDENTS OF EAST MELBOURNE HAVE BEEN HEARD
MUTTERING UNHAPPILY ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF BEING
HANDED OVER TO EITHER RICHMOND OR COLLINGWOOD
COUNCIL AND SIMILAR MUTTERINGS HAVE BEEN
HEARD IN PARTS OF CARLTON ABOUT ANNEXATION BY
EITHER FITZROY OR BRUNSWICK. THE GOVERNMENT,
FOR ITS PART, HAS SAID IT WILL GO AHEAD WITH
RESTRUCTURING THE CITY COUNCIL, IRRESPECTIVE OF
WHAT THE RATEPAYERS THINK. IN THE WORDS OF THE
LOCAL GOVERNMENT MINISTER, MR CROZIER: "THE
COUNCIL CAN CALL AS MANY REFERENDUMS AS IT
LIKES, BUT IT WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE." THE
GOVERNMENT, IN SHORT, HAS MADE ITS DECISION, AND
THAT IS THAT.
FOR A GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS EMPHASISED
THE NEED FOR CONSULTATION BETWEEN COMMUNITY
GROUPS AND GOVERNMENT, EITHER STATE OR LOCAL,
THIS IS A BOLD AND POTENTIALLY RISKY ATTITUDE TO
TAKE. WHAT HAPPENS, FOR EXAMPLE, IF A REFERENDUM
SHOWS THAT A CLEAR MAJORITY OF RATEPAYERS ARE
OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION? THE
GOVERNMENT WOULD BE HARD PUT TO ARGUE THEN
THAT IT WAS TAKING ACTION IN RESPONSE TO PUBLIC
NEED OR PRESSURE. THE LEAST IT COULD DO IN SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE TO RETHINK ITS PLANS. IN
GENERAL, THOUGH, REFORM OF THE COUNCIL IS
OVERDUE. OVER THE YEARS IT HAS BECOME A
SYNONYM FOR INTRIGUE, INCOMPETENCE AND
DITHERING. A CITY SQUARE THAT TOOK 10 YEARS TO
BUILD AND A MALL IN BOURKE STREET THAT MR
CROZIER APTLY DESCRIBES AS "HALF-BAKED" ARE
SYMPTOMATIC OF THE COUNCIL'S INABILITY TO GET
THINGS DONE.
MELBOURNE'S PROBLEMS ARE NOT ALL OF THE
COUNCIL'S MAKING. THE GOVERNMENT HAS
CONTRIBUTED TO THEM TOO BY POOR OR CUMBERSOME
PLANNING CONTROLS AND BY ITS OBSESSION WITH
EXPENSIVE MONUMENTS. NONETHELESS, IF MELBOURNE
IS TO GO AHEAD AT ALL (AS SYDNEY'S CENTRAL
BUSINESS DISTRICT HAS LATELY DONE) DRIVE,
DYNAMISM AND IMAGINATIVE DECISION-MAKING ARE
NECESSARY. ALL THREE QUALITIES HAVE BEEN IN SHORT
SUPPLY AT THE TOWN HALL FOR YEARS.
"A SPEED LIMIT OF 50 KMH?"
THERE ARE OBVIOUS ATTRACTIONS IN THE IDEA
OF REDUCING THE SPEED LIMIT FOR CARS ON
RESIDENTIAL STREETS, AS POLICE ARE NOW PROPOSING.
ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF STREETS ARE USED SOLELY
AS TRAFFIC ARTERIES. MOST OF THE STREETS WE LIVE
IN ARE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES BESIDES BEING
THOROUGHFARES FOR CARS - KIDS KICK A FOOTBALL,
THEY RIDE BIKES, WE CHAT WITH OUR NEIGHBORS.
WHEN ALMOST ONE IN FOUR ROAD DEATHS TODAY
ARE PEDESTRIANS, IT SEEMS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE
A LOWER SPEED LIMIT ON RESIDENTIAL STREETS SO THAT
THEIR OTHER USES ARE MORE COMPATIBLE WITH THEIR
TRAFFIC ROLE.
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS GOOD
IDEA WILL WORK IN PRACTICE. HOW WILL IT BE
ENFORCED? EVEN WITH A SPEED LIMIT OF 60 KMH
AS WE HAVE AT PRESENT, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT EVEN
ONE IN 100 CASES OF SPEEDING ARE PICKED UP BY
POLICE. THE LOWER THE SPEED LIMIT, THE LESS LIKELY
THAT IT WILL BE OBSERVED. IF MOTORISTS ARE TO OBEY
THE LOWER SPEED LIMIT, IT WOULD BE ONLY AFTER
CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES HAD BEEN DEVOTED TO
PUBLIC EDUCATION AND POLICE PATROLS TO MAKE
SURE THAT DRIVERS ACQUIRE A NEW HABIT OF GOING
SLOWLY ONCE OFF THE MAIN ROADS.
THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE IDEA IS FUTILE.
AN EXPERIMENT THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT OVER
THE PAST 18 MONTHS IN GEELONG AS PART OF THAT
CITY'S BIKEPLAN SUGGESTS THAT DRIVERS DO PAY
SOME HEED TO THE LOWER SPEED LIMITS. THE
GEELONG STUDY FOUND THAT DRIVERS AVERAGED
ABOUT 65 KMH IN THE 60 KMH ZONES, BUT ONLY
55 KMH IN THE 40 KMH ZONES. WHATEVER THIS
REVEALS ABOUT OUR OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW, IT
SUGGESTS THAT THE LOWER SPEED LIMIT DOES
INFLUENCE DRIVER BEHAVIOR - AND THUS MAKES
THE STREETS SAFER.
THE LOWER SPEED LIMIT WILL SOON BE GIVEN
A TRIAL IN COLLINGWOOD, AND ONE WISHES IT WELL.
BUT IT IS STILL TRUE THAT NOTHING IMPROVES ONE'S
DRIVING LIKE THE SIGHT OF A POLICE CAR ON THE
ROAD; OTHER MEASURES CANNOT SUBSTITUTE FOR
POLICE PATROLS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE POLICE ARE
EQUIPPED WITH PUFF BAGS. WE ALSO NEED TO PLACE
MORE EMPHASIS ON TRAINING IN ROAD SAFETY WITHIN
THE SCHOOLS. ROSTA HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED A
PROGRAMME TO TEACH PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN THE
ART OF SAFE CYCLING. IF ALL SCHOOLS TAKE THIS UP,
IT COULD PRODUCE A GENERATION BETTER TRAINED IN
ROAD SAFETY THAN ANY BEFORE IT.
<F76>
TUESDAY 6 JANUARY 1981
"SWITCH ON THE ELECTRICITY GRID"
SOME PROPOSALS EXCITE LITTLE COMMENT BECAUSE
THEY OFFEND NO ONE; YET THEY INCLUDE SOME OF
THE MOST USEFUL IDEAS ON THE AGENDA FOR ACTION.
THE PROPOSAL TO BUILD A POWER GRID LINKING THE
ELECTRICITY SYSTEMS OF THE FOUR SOUTH-EASTERN
STATES IS ONE OF THESE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
REASONS WHY IT MAKES EXCELLENT SENSE. NOW THAT
IT HAS WON THE PRESTIGIOUS BACKING OF THE
INSTITUTION OF ENGINEERS, IT SHOULD SOON BECOME
A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE FIVE GOVERNMENTS INVOLVED.
THE PROPOSAL PUT BY THE INSTITUTION IS FOR
THREE LARGE TRANSMISSION LINES TO BE BUILT BY
1992 TO LINK THE VICTORIAN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
SYSTEM WITH THOSE OF NSW, SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND
TASMANIA. THE FIRST WOULD EXTEND THE
CONTROVERSIAL ALCOA TRANSMISSION LINE FROM
PORTLAND TO ADELAIDE BY 1987; A SECOND WOULD
CROSS THE GREAT DIVIDE TO LINK THE LATROBE VALLEY
TO GOULBURN BY 1990, AND THE THIRD WOULD GO
UNDERWATER ALONG THE FLOOR OF BASS STRAIT TO
BELL BAY, NEAR LAUNCESTON. THE TOTAL COST OF THE
THREE WOULD BE $530 MILLION AT TODAY'S PRICES.
WHAT WOULD SUCH A $530 MILLION GRID DO? IN
ESSENCE, IT WOULD SAVE US HAVING TO BUILD NEW
POWER STATIONS THAT WOULD BE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE.
ALL STATE ELECTRICITY AUTHORITIES NOW MAINTAIN A
LARGE AMOUNT OF GENERATING CAPACITY IN RESERVE
TO SWITCH ON IN THOSE CRITICAL PERIODS WHEN AN
UNEXPECTED MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN THROWS A
MAJOR UNIT OUT OF OPERATION AT THE SAME TIME AS
THERE IS A HEAVY DEMAND FROM CONSUMERS. THE
VICTORIAN SEC, FOR INSTANCE, AIMS AT HAVING A
GENERATING CAPACITY 30 PER CENT GREATER THAN THE
EXPECTED MAXIMUM DEMAND TO COPE WITH ALL THE
THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG. IT CAN ENSURE THIS AT
PRESENT ONLY BY BUILDING MORE STATIONS AS
DEMAND GROWS.
THE PROPOSED INTERSTATE GRID WOULD GIVE US
A DIFFERENT KIND OF INSURANCE, AND A CHEAPER ONE
AT THAT. IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT ALL STATES WOULD
EXPERIENCE SERIOUS MECHANICAL BREAKDOWNS AT
ONCE. IF THEY COULD POOL THEIR RESERVE CAPACITIES
SO AS TO SUPPLY POWER TO EACH OTHER AT TIMES OF
CRISIS, EACH COULD OPERATE WITH A SMALLER RESERVE
CAPACITY - AND PUT OFF BUILDING NEW STATIONS.
THE INSTITUTION OF ENGINEERS ESTIMATES THAT THE
MONEY SAVED BY BUILDING THE GRID WOULD REACH
$2500 MILLION WITHIN 20 YEARS OF ITS OPERATION.
THE GRID WOULD OFFER PARTICULAR BENEFITS TO
VICTORIA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND
TASMANIA. VICTORIA NOW RELIES MAINLY ON MOIST
BROWN COAL, WHICH IS TWO-THIRDS WATER AND HENCE
DIFFICULT TO USE IN BOILERS WHICH HAVE TO SWITCH
OFF AND START UP AGAIN IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN
DEMAND. SOUTH AUSTRALIA, BY CONTRAST, IS BURNING
ITS SCARCE NATURAL GAS 24 HOURS A DAY TO PRODUCE
ELECTRICITY, WHILE TASMANIA IS PRESSING ON WITH
NEW HYDRO - ELECTRIC SCHEMES WHICH ARE
THREATENING ITS JUSTLY FAMOUS SOUTH-WEST
WILDERNESS.
THE PROPOSED GRID COULD ALLOW ALL THREE
STATES TO CO-ORDINATE THEIR POWER DEMAND AND
SUPPLY TO USE THE RIGHT FUEL FOR THE RIGHT JOB. THE
LATROBE VALLEY STATIONS COULD BURN BROWN COAL
ROUND THE CLOCK TO PRODUCE FULL-TIME POWER FOR
ALL THREE STATES, WHILE ADELAIDE'S GAS STATIONS
AND TASMANIA'S HYDRO PLANT COULD BE KEPT FOR
DAYTIME AND EVENING USE IN ALL THREE STATES. A
LARGER SYSTEM WOULD GIVE EACH STATE MORE
FLEXIBILITY, AND REDUCE COSTS ALL ROUND. IT WOULD
ALSO REMOVE ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR TASMANIA TO
DAM THE LOWER GORDON AND FRANKLIN RIVERS FOR
HYDRO POWER. THE SOONER IT IS BUILT, THE BETTER.
"CASE FOR NUDE BATHING BEACHES"
ONCE AGAIN THE SUMMER HAS BROUGHT OUT THE
POLICE, AS WELL AS NUDISTS, ON MELBOURNE'S
BEACHES. THE POLICE, WHO HAVE ARRESTED AND
CHARGED MORE THAN 20 PEOPLE AT SANDRINGHAM
AND BLACK ROCK IN RECENT WEEKS, INSIST THAT
NUDE BATHING ON A PUBLIC BEACH IS OFFENSIVE.
NUDISTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, CLAIM THAT THEY ARE
INDULGING IN HARMLESS RECREATION. IN OTHER STATES
THIS PROBLEM OF CONFLICTING INTERESTS HAS BEEN
RESOLVED BY GOVERNMENTS SETTING ASIDE PARTICULAR
BEACHES FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF NUDE
SUNBATHING. SYDNEY HAS ITS LADY JANE AND REEF
BEACHES, ADELAIDE HAS MASLINS AND ROBE BEACH,
DARWIN HAS CASUARINA, CANBERRA HAS ITS KAMBAH
POOL, WHILE QUEENSLAND - YES, PRUDISH
QUEENSLAND - HAS AN OFFICIAL NUDE BATHING
BEACH AT GRANITE BAY, 150 KILOMETRES FROM
BRISBANE.
BUT DESPITE REPEATED CALLS FROM NUDISTS, AS
WELL AS SURVEYS WHICH SHOW THAT AS MANY AS
THREE OUT OF FOUR VICTORIANS SUPPORT THE IDEA OF
OFFICIALLY PROCLAIMED AREAS FOR NUDE BATHING,
THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECLINED TO FOLLOW
SUIT. THE FORMER MINISTER FOR YOUTH, SPORT AND
RECREATION, MR DIXON, WENT SO FAR AS TO WRITE
TO MUNICIPAL COUNCILS REQUESTING THEIR VIEWS ON
THE MATTER. HE SAID HE WAS PERSONALLY IN FAVOR
OF SOME BEACHES OR INLAND WATER AREAS BEING
SET ASIDE FOR NUDE BATHING. BUT HIS VIEW IS NOT
SHARED BY CABINET.
NO ONE IS SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD
HAVE THE RIGHT TO BATHE NAKED ON EVERY BEACH
IN MELBOURNE. BUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH SETTING
ASIDE A LIMITED NUMBER OF RELATIVELY SECLUDED
BEACHES FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO DO SO? SUCH
BEACHES WOULD NOT BE THE EXCLUSIVE PROVINCE
OF NUDISTS; THOSE WHO FIND NUDITY OFFENSIVE
COULD SIMPLY STAY AWAY. THE STATE GOVERNMENT,
WHICH IS WELL BEHIND PUBLIC OPINION ON THIS
QUESTION, SHOULD RECONSIDER ITS STAND.

THURSDAY 8 JANUARY 1981
"JAPAN AND THE SECURITY DEBATE"
THE WESTERN ALLIANCE, AS USUAL, IS BAFFLED
ABOUT JAPAN. TOKYO HAS THROWN UP ANOTHER
DEFENCE BUDGET THAT WASHINGTON SEES AS
COMPLACENTLY MODEST. THE AMERICANS BELIEVE
THAT THE WORLD'S SECOND BIGGEST INDUSTRIAL
DEMOCRACY IS PAYING LIP SERVICE TO THE DEFENCE
OF THE "FREE WORLD" WHILE UNDERMINING ITS
ECONOMIES THROUGH THE MERCILESS EXPORT OF
GOODS. ACCORDING TO THE "FREE RIDE" SCHOOL,
JAPAN WANTS TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. MANY
WESTERNERS CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE
JAPANESE FIGHT SHY OF DEVOTING EVEN 1 PER CENT
OF THEIR GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT TO SECURITY, A
FRACTION OF THE SPENDING IN NATO COUNTRIES AND
A FIGURE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO JAPAN'S
ECONOMIC CLOUT. THEY SEE A COUNTRY THAT
IMPORTS 90 PER CENT OF ITS ENERGY AND HALF ITS
FOOD AND WHOSE DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTED
RESOURCES GROWS IN TANDEM WITH THE ECONOMY.
JAPAN IS CRITICALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS INTERNATIONAL
LIFELINE AND THEREFORE CRITICALLY VULNERABLE. EVEN
IF IT SHOULD IGNORE ITS "FREE WORLD"
RESPONSIBILITIES, WHAT ABOUT JAPAN'S
RESPONSIBILITY TO ITSELF? IN PLAIN LANGUAGE, THEY
SAY THAT AN UNDEFENDED COUNTRY AS INDUSTRIALLY
DEVELOPED AND AFFLUENT AS JAPAN WILL BE DONE
IN BY ITS NEIGHBORS.
ALL OF THIS IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF A GREAT
DEBATE AMONG JAPANESE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE
THE END OF WORLD WAR II. FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS
IT WAS TABOO TO QUESTION THE THREE PILLARS OF
SECURITY: A MINIMAL SELF-DEFENCE CAPABILITY, THE
AMERICAN NUCLEAR UMBRELLA, AND PEACEFUL
DIPLOMACY - OR WHAT SOME CALL THE EVASION OF
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES. (TO THESE MAY BE ADDED
A FOURTH PILLAR: THAT JAPAN MAY HAVE BECOME
ECONOMICALLY POWERFUL AND SECURE NOT SO MUCH
THROUGH THE PROTECTION IT ENJOYED UNDER THE
UNITED STATES AS BY REJECTING A HEAVY MILITARY
BURDEN.) BUT TODAY DEFENCE SPENDING NO LONGER
FACES UNBENDING OPPOSITION AND A DEBATE HAS
FLOURISHED. PUBLIC OPINION IS CHANGING. A RECENT
POLL SHOWED THAT EIGHT OUT OF 10 RESPONDENTS
INDICATED SUPPORT FOR THE SELF-DEFENCE FORCE.
MANY CALLED FOR AN INCREASED DEFENCE CAPABILITY.
THE ARMY AGREES, OF COURSE, AND SO DOES A
GROWING NUMBER OF BUSINESSMEN, INDUSTRIALISTS
AND POLITICIANS OF WHOM SOME WILL HAVE VESTED
INTERESTS TO PURSUE. THE RULING LIBERAL
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS SYMPATHETIC TO EXPANDING
MILITARY EXPENDITURE AND HAS THE PARLIAMENTARY
MAJORITY TO BACK IT UP. EVEN THE OPPOSITION
PARTIES ARE MODERATING THEIR TRADITIONAL ATTACKS
ON THE DEFENCE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE UNITED
STATES-JAPAN SECURITY TREATY. IN A SPAN OF 24
DAYS TOWARDS THE END OF LAST YEAR, THE FOREIGN
MINISTRY, THE DEFENCE AGENCY, AND THE ECONOMIC
PLANNING BODY ISSUED STATEMENTS REVERSING
DECADES OF INTROSPECTIVE POLICY. FOR THE FIRST
TIME IT WAS STATED OFFICIALLY THAT JAPAN SHOULD
BE CONSIDERED PART OF A GLOBAL EFFORT TO COMBAT
SOVIET MILITARY AND POLITICAL ADVANCES.
A WHITE PAPER POINTED OUT THE DEFICIENCIES
OF JAPANESE DEFENCE IN THE FACE OF AN EXPANDING
SOVIET PACIFIC FLEET, THE DEPLOYMENT OF BACKFIRE
BOMBERS AND BALLISTIC MISSILES IN THE FAR EAST,
AND THE STATIONING OF SOVIET MILITARY UNITS ON
THE KURIL ISLANDS CLAIMED BY JAPAN. IT DETAILED
SOVIET MILITARY MANOEUVRES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
WHICH COINCIDED WITH PERSISTENT REPORTS IN THE
JAPANESE PRESS OF SOVIET AIRCRAFT PATROLLING THE
COASTLINE AND SOVIET SUBMARINES LURKING IN THE
SHIPPING LANES. THE AMERICAN DEFEAT IN VIETNAM,
THE SUBSEQUENT DOMINATION OF INDO-CHINA BY
HANOI, THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO
WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA, THE CHINESE
RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE WEST, AND ITS PEACE
TREATY WITH JAPAN, THE AFGHANISTAN INVASION AND
THE PERSIAN GULF WAR HAVE ALL HELPED TO
CONCENTRATE JAPANESE MINDS ON SECURITY AND LED
THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME TO EMPHASISE
JAPAN'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE WEST.
ABOVE ALL THEY HAVE LED TO AN EXAMINATION
OF THE SELF-DEFENCE FORCE, WITH A QUARTER OF A
MILLION MEN AND AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF ABOUT
$10,000 MILLION, WHICH MAKES JAPAN THE WORLD'S
SEVENTH BIGGEST SPENDER ON MILITARY MATTERS.
THESE FIGURES SEEM IMPRESSIVE, CERTAINLY IN
AUSTRALIAN TERMS. BUT AT 0.9 PER CENT OF GNP
THEY DO LITTLE TO EASE FEARS OF VULNERABILITY IN
TERMS OF JAPAN'S ECONOMIC PECULIARITIES AND ITS
PROXIMITY TO THE SOVIET UNION. THEY DO NOTHING
TO EXPLAIN WHAT MILITARY MEN SEE AS A SET OF
SERIOUS WEAKNESSES: THE ABSENCE OF AN INTEGRATED
COMMAND STRUCTURE, INADEQUATE PROVISION FOR
DEALING WITH EMERGENCIES, VULNERABLE AIRCRAFT
AND AIRFIELDS, UNSOPHISTICATED ELECTRONIC
EQUIPMENT IN THE AIR FORCE AND NAVY, THE NAVY'S
LACK OF AIR DEFENCE AND ANTI-SHIPPING MISSILES
AND AN ARMY EQUIPPED LARGELY WITH OBSOLETE
EQUIPMENT.
SO IF ALL THE PROBLEMS ARE NOW CLEARLY
DEFINED, DEFENCE IS NO LONGER A FORBIDDEN SUBJECT
AND THE DECISION MAKERS AGREE THAT SOMETHING
SHOULD BE DONE, WHY WAS SUCH AN INSIGNIFICANT
INCREASE IN SPENDING WRUNG LAST MONTH FROM THE
ECONOMICS MINISTERS WHO DOMINATE THE CABINET?
WHY DO JAPANESE DECISIONS ON DEFENCE SPENDING
SEEM TO BE INFLUENCED LESS BY THE QUESTION OF
HOW MUCH SECURITY WILL BE IMPROVED THAN BY
THE QUESTION OF WHAT INCREASE IS NEEDED TO
REDUCE FRICTION WITH THE UNITED STATES?
FOR ONE THING, THE ISSUE IS STILL EXTREMELY
SENSITIVE, EVEN 35 YEARS AFTER WORLD WAR II.
THIS SENSITIVITY IS REFLECTED IN THE DEBATE, WHICH
MAY APPEAR TO BE OBSESSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE BUT
IN FACT HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN. IT IS FULL OF
EUPHEMISM AND RHETORIC AND ITS CONCLUSIONS ARE
AMORPHOUS. FROM THE OUTSIDE, MOVEMENT
TOWARDS A MORE REALISTIC DEFENCE POLICY MUST
SEEM FRUSTRATINGLY SLOW. PUBLIC OPINION MAY BE
MOVING TOWARDS A GENERAL ACCEPTANCE THAT
CHANGES ARE NEEDED, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE
MISTAKEN FOR ENTHUSIASM.
FOR ANOTHER THING, SOME JAPANESE BELIEVE
THAT AFTER THE WAR THE COUNTRY DECIDED TO
RELINQUISH ITS CLAIM TO BEING A STATE WHOSE
ESSENCE IS MILITARY STRENGTH, AND DECIDED TO
BECOME A SOCIETY WHOSE ESSENCE IS ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY. AT THE HEART OF IT ALL IS JAPAN'S POST-WAR
CONSTITUTION, WHICH RENOUNCES FOR EVER THE
SOVEREIGN RIGHT OF THE NATION TO WAGE WAR OR TO
USE EVEN THE THREAT OF FORCE AS A MEANS OF
SETTLING INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES. IT WAS RUN UP IN
A WEEK BY LAWYERS IN THE AMERICAN ARMY OF
OCCUPATION, WITH ALMOST IMMEDIATE REGRET BY
THE UNITED STATES.
BUT THE JAPANESE HAVE TAKEN THE
CONSTITUTION DEADLY SERIOUSLY. ALTHOUGH IT HAS
NOT STOPPED A GRADUAL MOVE AWAY FROM PACIFISM,
AND IS IN ITSELF NO BARRIER TO INCREASED DEFENCE
SPENDING, ALL ATTEMPTS AT AMENDMENT HAVE BEEN
REBUFFED BY POPULAR SENTIMENT. WORLD WAR II
REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOLOGICAL FENCE,
PARTICULARLY ON THE QUESTION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS
AND JAPAN'S THREE NON-NUCLEAR PRINCIPLES: NOT
POSSESSING, MAKING OR PERMITTING THE PRESENCE
OF SUCH ARMS. ANY COMPROMISE THERE IS
UNTHINKABLE - UNDERSTANDABLY AND CORRECTLY.
THE DEBATE IS ABOUT REACHING FOR NATIONAL
AGREEMENT ON SECURITY, AND HOWEVER PRAGMATIC
THE JAPANESE MAY BE IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR THE
ADOPTION OF A MORE REALISTIC ROLE IN THE WESTERN
ALLIANCE. IN SAFER TIMES AND IN A MORE IDEALISTIC
WORLD, THE JAPANESE WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE TO US
ALL.
<F78>
FRIDAY 9 JANUARY 1981
"FLYING KANGAROO UP FOR SALE?"
THE QANTAS ADVERTISING JINGLE ON TELEVISION
REFERS TO "THE PROUD AUSTRALIAN OWNERS OF
THE FLYING KANGAROO". IT IS AN APPROPRIATE LABEL,
FOR AUSTRALIANS HAVE GOOD REASON TO BE PROUD
OF THEIR NATIONAL FLAG-CARRIER. QANTAS,
GOVERNMENT OWNED AND THEREFORE PUBLICLY
OWNED, IS A RELIABLE AND SAFE AIRLINE. TRUE, IT
HAS FAILINGS. BUT MANY OF THEM CAN BE ATTRIBUTED
TO GOVERNMENT AND BUREAUCRATIC INTERFERENCE
IN THE AIRLINE'S PLANNING AND, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT,
ITS OPERATIONS. THIS INTERFERENCE, ACCORDING TO
THE AIRLINE'S NEW CHAIRMAN, MR JIM LESLIE, HAS
CONTRIBUTED TO THE CARRIER'S POOR FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE IN RECENT YEARS.
THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, HAS NOT STOPPED
THERE. ACCORDING TO THE QANTAS BOARD, THE
GOVERNMENT IS DELIBERATELY WEAKENING THE
AIRLINE IN AN EFFORT TO SET IT UP FOR TAKEOVER. OF
COURSE, SUCH SUSPICIONS ARE NOT NEW. SINCE THE
MID-1960S, THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN UNDER
PRESSURE FROM SECTIONS OF THE LIBERAL PARTY AND
SOME PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS COM-
MUNITY TO SELL QANTAS TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.
THEIR ARGUMENT HAS BEEN IDEOLOGICAL: THAT IN A
CAPITALIST SYSTEM GOVERNMENTS SHOULD NOT BE
INVOLVED IN ENTERPRISES THAT DO NOT PROVIDE
ESSENTIAL SERVICES. THE SAME ARGUMENT HAS BEEN
PUT IN SUPPORT OF SELLING TAA. BUT FOR REASONS
BEST KNOWN TO THEMSELVES, SUCCESSIVE GOVERN-
MENTS HAVE IGNORED THE PRESSURE.
THIS TIME, HOWEVER, QANTAS BELIEVES THE
GOVERNMENT HAS SUCCUMBED. AT A MEETING
WITH THE TRANSPORT MINISTER, MR. HUNT, ON
WEDNESDAY, MR LESLIE AND SIX OF THE OTHER
SEVEN QANTAS DIRECTORS ALLEGED THAT THE
GOVERNMENT ALREADY HAD TAKEN FIVE OF THE NINE
STEPS THAT WOULD DAMAGE THE AIRLINE TO THE
EXTENT THAT IT WOULD BE RIPE FOR TAKEOVER AT
A BARGAIN PRICE. THE GOVERNMENT HAD FRUSTRATED
AND NEUTRALISED THE QANTAS BOARD, FORCED THE
AIRLINE INTO LOSSES BY DELAYING FARE RISES TO PAY
FOR FUEL-PRICE INCREASES, AND ENSURED THAT
QANTAS COULD NOT ATTRACT THE MANAGERIAL TALENT
IT NEEDED BY RESTRICTING SALARIES. FURTHER, QANTAS
HAD BEEN LOCKED OUT OF NEGOTIATIONS OVER
DOMESTIC AIR SERVICES - IT HAD OFFERED TO
PROVIDE CHEAPER FARES BETWEEN PERTH AND THE
EASTERN CAPITALS - AND WAS NOT EVEN TOLD FOR
OVER TWO MONTHS OF THE EFFECTS ON QANTAS OF
THE NEW TWO-AIRLINE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
GOVERNMENT, TAA AND ANSETT. QANTAS BELIEVES
THAT IN THE COMING REVIEW OF THE OPERATION OF
INTERNATIONAL SERVICES, THE GOVERNMENT COULD
GIVE SOME OF ITS MOST PROFITABLE ROUTES TO THE
MURDOCH-ABELES CONTROLLED ANSETT EMPIRE, AND
TAA.
QANTAS'S MAIN OBJECTION APPEARS TO BE
THAT WHILE, IN EFFECT, TAA OR ANSETT OR BOTH
DOMESTIC AIRLINES HAD THE RIGHT UNDER THE TWO-
AIRLINE AGREEMENT TO VETO ITS APPLICATION TO
OPERATE RIVAL DISCOUNTED SERVICES BETWEEN PERTH
AND THE EASTERN CAPITALS, QANTAS HAS NO RIGHT TO
VETO ANSETT OR TAA APPLICATIONS TO COMPETE
WITH OR REPLACE QANTAS SERVICES OVERSEAS.
GOVERNMENT APPROVAL OF ANSETT OR TAA PLANS
TO FLY ON QANTAS'S PROFITABLE SOUTH PACIFIC
ROUTES WOULD BE THE SIXTH STEP IN MR LESLIE'S
SELL-OUT SCENARIO. WHAT COULD FOLLOW, ACCORDING
TO THE AIRLINE'S CHAIRMAN, WOULD BE A SHACKLING
OF QANTAS TO A HOST OF UNPROFITABLE ROUTES,
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY FOR MORE FOREIGN AIRLINES
TO COMPETE WITH QANTAS, THUS REDUCING ITS SHARE
OF THE MARKET EVEN FURTHER AND, FINALLY, THE
SALE OF THE AIRLINE.
TRUE, THE QANTAS BOARD MIGHT BE OVER-
REACTING. BUT IT CERTAINLY SEEMS THAT THE
GOVERNMENT HAS TREATED IT POORLY IN RECENT
YEARS. THE AMBITIONS OF ANSETT TRANSPORT
INDUSTRIES' NEW OWNERS ARE HARDLY SECRET. NOR
IS THEIR POLITICAL INFLUENCE. THEY WOULD LIKE TO
ZEALAND. WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO IS
DECLARE ITS INTENTIONS. WHY HAS IT PUT QANTAS
INTO A STRAITJACKET? WHY HAS IT KEPT THE
AIRLINE'S BOARD - THE PUBLIC'S AGENTS - IN THE
DARK? THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD LET QANTAS AND
ITS OWNERS IN ON THE SECRET.
"PM'S BY-ELECTION PROBLEMS"
IF THERE IS ONE THING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER,
MR FRASER, AND HIS GOVERNMENT CAN WELL DO
WITHOUT AT PRESENT, IT IS A NEW OUTBREAK OF
HOSTILITIES BETWEEN QUEENSLAND'S LIBERAL PARTY
AND THE NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY. YET THAT SEEMS
ONE OF THE LIKELY CONSEQUENCES OF THE SUDDEN AND
TRAGIC DEATH OF THE FORMER FINANCE MINISTER, MR
ERIC ROBINSON. MR ROBINSON WAS A STERN CRITIC
OF THE QUEENSLAND PREMIER, MR BJELKE-PETERSEN,
AND HIS NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY, AND AN EQUALLY
STERN CHAMPION OF THE LIBERAL PARTY. HE WAS ALSO
CRITICAL OF MR FRASER'S LEADERSHIP STYLE, REJECTING
THE VIEW THAT THE COALITION PARTNERS NEEDED TO
PATCH UP THEIR DIFFERENCES AND WORK TOGETHER IN
ORDER TO KEEP THE ALP OUT.
THESE CONVICTIONS LED TO MR ROBINSON BEING
CHALLENGED AT THE LAST FEDERAL ELECTIONS BY AN
INDEPENDENT NATIONAL PARTY CANDIDATE WHO HAD
THE BACKING OF MR BJELKE-PETERSEN. MR ROBINSON
RETAINED HIS GOLD COAST SEAT OF MCPHERSON, BUT
WITH A REDUCTION OF 17 PER CENT IN HIS MAJORITY.
A FURTHER DROP OF 4 PER CENT IN THE LIBERAL VOTE
COULD SEE THE SEAT SLIP FROM LIBERAL PARTY HANDS.
FOR THIS REASON THE NATIONALS ARE LIKELY TO MAKE
A HARD FIGHT OF THE BY-ELECTION. THEY WON THE
FOUR SOUTH COAST SEATS FROM THE LIBERALS AT THE
NOVEMBER STATE ELECTIONS. THEY WILL BE OUT TO
DO THE SAME AGAIN WITH THE FEDERAL SEAT OF
MCPHERSON.
MR FRASER COULD PLAY FOR TIME, OF COURSE,
DELAYING THE BY-ELECTION WHILE HE TRIES TO PATCH
UP THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COALITION
PARTNERS. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS STRATEGY IS THAT
MR FRASER HAS TWO OTHER BY-ELECTIONS PENDING.
THESE ARE FOR THE SEATS OF CURTIN AND BOOTHBY,
MADE VACANT BY THE APPOINTMENT OF MR VIC
GARLAND AND MR JOHN MCLEAY TO DIPLOMATIC
POSITIONS ABROAD. NORMALLY GOVERNMENTS LIKE TO
HOLD BY-ELECTIONS TOGETHER, RATHER THAN STAGGER
THEM. IN THIS WAY THE DAMAGE DONE BY AN ADVERSE
VOTE IS MINIMISED. BUT THE CURTIN AND BOOTHBY
BY-ELECTIONS HAD PROVISIONALLY BEEN SCHEDULED
FOR APRIL, AND THAT MAY BE TOO EARLY FOR THE
LIBERALS TO GET THEIR QUEENSLAND HOUSE IN ORDER.
MR FRASER HAS ALREADY BEEN CRITICISED BY
QUEENSLAND LIBERALS FOR FAILING TO STAND UP
PUBLICLY TO THE NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY IN
QUEENSLAND DURING THE FEDERAL ELECTIONS. THIS
WEEK HE WAS CRITICISED AT THE YOUNG LIBERALS'
CONFERENCE IN HOBART ON THE SAME GROUNDS.
WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT, MR FRASER WILL HAVE
TO THROW HIS WEIGHT SOLIDLY BEHIND THE LIBERAL
PARTY CANDIDATE FOR THE MCPHERSON BY-ELECTION,
OR RUN THE RISK OF BEING ONCE MORE BRANDED AS
DISLOYAL.

MONDAY 12 JANUARY 1981
"THE ABANDONMENT OF INDEXATION"
THE BREAKDOWN OF WAGE INDEXATION,
REPEATEDLY FOREWARNED AND NOW
ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE ARBITRATION COMMISSION,
COMES AS NO SURPRISE. BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS
DISTURBING. WITH ITS LIMITATIONS AND LOOPHOLES,
INDEXATION WAS FAR FROM BEING A PERFECT SYSTEM
OF ORDERLY NATIONAL WAGE ADJUSTMENTS. BUT IT
HAD ITS ADVANTAGES, AND IF SOCIAL JUSTICE OUGHT TO
TEMPER ECONOMIC FORCES, IT WAS PREFERABLE TO
HARSHER ALTERNATIVES. THE COLLAPSE OF INDEXATION
IS REGRETTABLE FOR ANOTHER, MORE DAUNTING REASON.
IT CONFIRMS AN UNDERLYING LACK OF CONSENSUS THAT
AUGURS ILL FOR ANY VIABLE AND ACCEPTABLE
ALTERNATIVE FORM OF WAGE DETERMINATION. THAT
THERE SHOULD BE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN
EMPLOYERS AND UNIONS MUST BE ACCEPTED AS
NATURAL. THE PROBLEM IS THAT BOTH SIDES SEEM
UNABLE TO AGREE EVEN ON THE BASIC RULES UNDER
WHICH THESE CONFLICTS SHOULD BE ADJUDICATED, AND
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, RESPONSIBLE TO THE
WHOLE COMMUNITY FOR ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
AND SOCIAL EQUITY, LACKS SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO
IMPOSE ITS WILL.
THE ARBITRATION COMMISSION INTRODUCED
THE CONCEPT OF WAGE INDEXATION IN APRIL 1975,
AFTER A PERIOD OF STEEP PAY RISES, SOARING
INFLATION AND A SUBSEQUENT SLUMP IN BUSINESS
PROFITS AND EMPLOYMENT. THE IDEA WAS TO
MODERATE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES BY REGULARLY
COMPENSATING WAGE EARNERS FOR RISES IN THE COST
OF LIVING, AS MEASURED BY THE CONSUMER PRICE
INDEX, AND TO DO SO EQUITABLY. IT WAS ALSO HOPED
THAT THIS ORDERLY SYSTEM OF WAGE DETERMINATION
WOULD IMPROVE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. THE WHOLE
FRAGILE PACKAGE DEPENDED ON WHAT THE
COMMISSION TERMED "SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE".
THIS MEANT THAT EXCEPT FOR SPECIAL PROVISION FOR
PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES, WORK VALUE CHANGES AND
THE REMEDY OF ANOMALIES, THERE WERE TO BE NO
PRESSURES FOR WAGE RISES OUTSIDE THE REGULAR
ADJUSTMENTS AND GUIDELINES.
ONE DIFFICULTY WAS THAT INDEXATION WAS
DESIGNED TO SATISFY CONFLICTING, PERHAPS
IRRECONCILABLE, DEMANDS, AND THAT -
UNDERSTANDABLY - IT FAILED TO DO SO. EMPLOYERS
COMPLAINED THAT INDEXATION IMPOSED ON THEM
REGULAR AND BURDENSOME COST INCREASES
REGARDLESS OF THEIR CAPACITY TO PAY. THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT ARGUED THAT INDEXATION INSTITUTION-
ALISED INFLATION, IMPEDED ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND
BOOSTED UNEMPLOYMENT. IT THEREFORE URGED THE
COMMISSION, WITH ONLY PARTIAL SUCCESS, TO
DISCOUNT INDEXATION FOR PRICE INCREASES DUE TO
GOVERNMENT TAXES AND CHARGES. THE ACTU,
WHILE IN FAVOR OF ORDERLY, CENTRALISED WAGE
FIXING, FOUND THAT INDEXATION DID NOT FULLY
COMPENSATE WORKERS FOR COST OF LIVING INCREASES.
ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL OPPOSITION LEADER,
MR HAYDEN, AVERAGE WAGE EARNERS SINCE 1974
HAVE FALLEN BEHIND BY $29 WHAT THEY NOW SHOULD
BE EARNING HAD THEY RECEIVED FULL INDEXATION PLUS
FAIRLY SHARED PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES.
THE MAIN REASON FOR THE BREAKDOWN,
HOWEVER, WAS THE EROSION OF "SUBSTANTIAL
COMPLIANCE" WITH THE GUIDELINES. MILITANT AND
POWERFUL UNIONS WERE ABLE TO POCKET THE BENEFITS
OF INDEXATION AND SUCCESSFULLY PRESS FOR
ADDITIONAL PAY RISES. IN SOME CASES, EMPLOYERS
YIELDED UNDER DURESS. IN OTHERS, THE ARBITRATION
COMMISSION ITSELF RECOGNISED SOME RATHER
DUBIOUS "WORK VALUE" CLAIMS IN THE INTERESTS OF
INDUSTRIAL PEACE. BOTH THE COMMISSION AND
EMPLOYERS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO STEM THE PRESSURES
FOR FLOW-ONS FROM WAGE SETTLEMENTS OUTSIDE THE
STRICT GUIDELINES. THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE 35-HOUR
WEEK, ALTHOUGH NOW BEING CO-ORDINATED BY THE
ACTU, MAY WELL HAVE BEEN THE FATAL BLOW TO
INDEXATION.
WHAT NOW? THE GOVERNMENT AND EMPLOYERS
MAY PAY DEARLY FOR THEIR DWINDLING SUPPORT FOR
INDEXATION. THE ACTU PRESIDENT, MR DOLAN, HAS
WARNED THAT UNIONS WOULD PRESS CLAIMS AGAINST
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYERS FOR WAGE INCREASES "BY
DIRECT NEGOTIATION AND ACTION ON THE JOB". A
WAVE OF INDUSTRIAL DISRUPTION, PLUS THE COST OF
SATISFYING DEMANDS, COULD PROVE TO BE MORE
EXPENSIVE AND MORE DAMAGING TO THE ECONOMY
THAN INDEXATION WITH ALL ITS COSTS AND BREACHES.
FOR WAGE EARNERS, THE ABANDONMENT OF
INDEXATION IS LIKELY TO BE A MIXED BLESSING.
THOSE IN A STRONG BARGAINING POSITION MAY
MANAGE TO KEEP PACE WITH INFLATION OR EVEN
RUN AHEAD OF IT; THOSE WHO ARE INDUSTRIALLY
WEAKER ARE LIKELY TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND.
A PRIVATE CONFERENCE TO BE CHAIRED NEXT
WEEK BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION, SIR
JOHN MOORE, IS TO DECIDE WHETHER A PUBLIC
INQUIRY SHOULD BE HELD ON THE FUTURE OF WAGE
DETERMINATION. A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE PRESENT,
DEFECTIVE SYSTEM IS CERTAINLY NECESSARY. BUT THE
PROSPECTS FOR CONSENSUS ON A FAIR AND WORKABLE
ALTERNATIVE ARE NOT GOOD. ON ONE HAND, A MOVE
IN THE DIRECTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WOULD
GO AGAINST THE AUSTRALIAN TRADITION THAT WAGE
INCREASES SHOULD BE FAIRLY SHARED. ON THE OTHER
HAND, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LACKS THE
CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS TO IMPOSE, EVEN IF IT SO
WISHED, A PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY. THE HOPE
MUST BE THAT A MORE EFFECTIVE SYSTEM, BALANCING
THE CONFLICTING PRESSURES OF ECONOMIC REALITIES
AND SOCIAL JUSTICE, WILL EVOLVE. BUT IT IS A FLIMSY
HOPE.
<F80>
TUESDAY 13 JANUARY 1981
"THIS IS NO JOB FOR THE BOYS"
RARELY IN AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY HAS A JUDGE
AROUSED AS MUCH CONTROVERSY AS SIR GARFIELD
BARWICK IN HIS FINAL YEARS AS CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE
HIGH COURT. HIS SECRET ADVICE TO SIR JOHN KERR
ON THE SACKING OF THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT; HIS
CONSISTENCY IN INTERPRETING TAX LAWS IN A WAY
THAT HAS ALLOWED WIDE SCOPE FOR TAX AVOIDANCE;
HIS DECISION TO SIT ON CASES INVOLVING COMPANIES
IN WHICH HIS FAMILY COMPANY OWNED SHARES; HIS
DEDICATION TO MAKING THE NEW HIGH COURT
BUILDING THE LAST WORD IN SUCH ARCHITECTURE,
REGARDLESS OF PUBLIC EXPENSE - ALL THESE
CONTROVERSIES INVOLVING ITS CHIEF HAVE MADE THE
COURT BETTER KNOWN TO AUSTRALIANS, BUT ONLY AT
THE RISK OF LOWERING ITS STANDING IN THE
COMMUNITY.
DISRESPECT FOR JUDGES IS SOON TRANSLATED INTO
DISRESPECT FOR THE LEGAL SYSTEM. NOW, WITH SIR
GARFIELD'S RETIREMENT IMMINENT, THERE IS A SERIOUS
DANGER THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL FURTHER
ENDANGER THE STANDING OF THE HIGH COURT BY
APPOINTING ONE OF ITS OWN MEN TO SUCCEED HIM -
THE MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS, MR R.J.ELLICOTT.
CANBERRA RUMORS MURMUR THAT MR ELLICOTT IS ON
A SHORT LIST OF THREE FOR THE POSITION OF CHIEF
JUSTICE OF AUSTRALIA, THE HIGHEST POST IN A LEGAL
SYSTEM THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPARTIAL, ABOVE
ALL ELSE.
THE CASE AGAINST THE APPOINTMENT OF MR
ELLICOTT IS A STRONG ONE. IF JUSTICE IS TO BE SEEN TO
BE IMPARTIAL, THEN ITS JUDGES MUST BE SEEN TO BE
IMPARTIAL. THE HIGH COURT IS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE
ARBITER OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IN AUSTRALIA, AS WELL
AS THE FINAL COURT OF APPEAL. IT IS IN A SENSE THE
UMPIRE OF AUSTRALIAN POLITICS. TO APPOINT AN
ACTIVE POLITICIAN AS ITS CHIEF - PARTICULARLY A
POLITICIAN WHO WAS ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF THE
DIVISIVE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS OF 1975 - WOULD BE
TO INVITE THE PUBLIC TO SEE IT AS A STACKED COURT.
THIS IS NOT A JOB FOR ONE OF THE BOYS. IT
REQUIRES SOMEONE WHO IS RESPECTED BY THE
COMMUNITY GENERALLY, AND NOT JUST BY THOSE ON
THE GOVERNMENT'S SIDE OF POLITICS. IT REQUIRES
SOMEONE WHO IS NOT ONLY ADEPT IN LEGAL PRINCIPLES
AND REASONING, BUT WHO CAN BRING TO THE BENCH
A CERTAIN KIND OF MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL
LEADERSHIP: SOMEONE WITH A CREATIVE APPROACH TO
THE LAW, THAT COMMON SENSE WE CALL WISDOM, AND
A CONCERN FOR THE PRACTICAL EFFECTS OF THE COURT'S
DECISIONS ON INDIVIDUALS AND THE COMMUNITY. LET
THE GOVERNMENT SEEK FOR SUCH A PERSON ON THE
PRESENT COURT, ON THE BENCH GENERALLY, AMONG THE
BAR AND IN THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE. MR ELLICOTT
SHOULD STAY WHERE HE IS.
"QANTAS STILL IN DANGER"
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NO INTENTION OF
SELLING OR UNDERMINING ITS OWN INTERNATIONAL
AIRLINE, QANTAS. THE TRANSPORT MINISTER, MR
HUNT, SAYS SO. HIS ASSURANCE WOULD BE MORE
WELCOME IF WE COULD BE SURE THAT THE
GOVERNMENT MEANT WHAT IT SAID, AND THAT IT
WOULD NOT BE PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENT WHICH
MIGHT WEAKEN QANTAS'S POSITION. THE PROBLEM
IS THAT SUCH AN AGREEMENT ALREADY EXISTS. THIS
IS THE TWO-AIRLINE AGREEMENT SIGNED LAST
SEPTEMBER AND DUE TO GO BEFORE THE NEXT SESSION
OF PARLIAMENT.
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EITHER TAA OR ANSETT,
OR BOTH AIRLINES, COULD VETO PLANS BY QANTAS TO
OPERATE A DISCOUNTED SERVICE ON INTERNAL ROUTES
SUCH AS THE ONE BETWEEN PERTH AND THE EASTERN
CAPITALS. HOWEVER, QANTAS WOULD NOT HAVE THE
CORRESPONDING RIGHT OF VETO OVER APPLICATIONS BY
TAA OR ANSETT TO COMPETE WITH OR REPLACE
QANTAS SERVICES OVERSEAS. EITHER WAY, QANTAS
CANNOT WIN. THE AUSTRALIAN FLAG CARRIER
COULD FIND ITSELF DEPRIVED OF SOME OF THE
PROFITABLE SOUTH PACIFIC ROUTES IN WHICH ANSETT
PARTICULARLY HAS SHOWN A KEEN INTEREST. BUT IT
WOULD BE DENIED THE CHANCE TO RECOUP SOME OF
ITS LOSSES BY COMPETING WITH THE DOMESTIC
CARRIERS ON DOMESTIC ROUTES. IN THE END QANTAS
COULD WIND UP WITH THE TAILINGS - UNPROFITABLE
ROUTES AND A REDUCED SHARE OF THE INTERNATIONAL
MARKET.
ON THE FACE OF IT, THERE SEEMS TO BE A VERY
GOOD CASE FOR MAKING QANTAS A PARTY TO THE
AGREEMENT WITH THE SAME VETO RIGHTS AS THE TWO
DOMESTIC CARRIERS. HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT
SHOWS NO SIGNS OF DOING SO. MR HUNT HAS
REFERRED THE AGREEMENT TO THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S
DEPARTMENT FOR AN OPINION. BUT IN ANSWER TO
QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM BY 'THE AGE', HE SAID HE
REMAINED SATISFIED THAT THE INTERESTS OF QANTAS
WERE PROTECTED. MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF QANTAS
DO NOT THINK SO. THEY FEEL THE DICE HAVE BEEN
LOADED UNFAIRLY AGAINST THEM, AND MR HUNT'S
STATEMENT HAS DONE NOTHING TO PERSUADE THEM
OTHERWISE. NOR DOES IT ANSWER THE ALL-IMPORTANT
QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTIONS
TOWARDS TAA AND ANSETT? IS IT INTENDED THAT
THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SPREAD THEIR WINGS
BEYOND AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND - A PROSPECT
THAT WOULD BRING JOY TO THE MURDOCH-ABELES
CONTROLLED ANSETT EMPIRE? MR HUNT WAS
DISAPPOINTINGLY NON-COMMITTAL ON THIS POINT. HE
CAN HARDLY COMPLAIN IF PEOPLE SUSPECT THAT THE
GOVERNMENT'S INTENTIONS ARE NOT AS CLEARCUT AS
IT CLAIMS THEY ARE, AND THAT QANTAS DOES INDEED
FACE A THREATENED FUTURE.
<F81>
WEDNESDAY 14 JANUARY 1981
"AN AFFORDABLE HEALTH SCHEME"
A NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME SHOULD
IDEALLY ENSURE THAT NO ONE IN THE COMMUNITY
IS DENIED ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE, THAT THE PUBLIC
COSTS OF PROVIDING SUCH CARE ARE KEPT WITHIN
REASONABLE BOUNDS, AND THAT THE BURDEN OF THESE
COSTS IS EQUITABLY SHARED. THE MEDIBANK SCHEME
INTRODUCED BY THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT FAIRLY
EFFECTIVELY MET THE FIRST AND THIRD OBJECTIVES, BUT,
PARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER FULLY IMPLEMENTED
AS DESIGNED AND BECAUSE IT COINCIDED WITH AN
INFLATIONARY SURGE, IT FAILED TO CONSTRAIN HEALTH
CARE COSTS. IN DISMANTLING MEDIBANK FOR MAINLY
POLITICAL REASONS, THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAS
COMMENDABLY PRESERVED ITS FIRST ESSENTIAL
ELEMENT BY CONTINUING TO GUARANTEE THAT
EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF MEANS, HAS ACCESS TO
MINIMUM HEALTH CARE. BUT SUCCESSIVE, CONFUSING
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM HAVE
FAILED TO CONTAIN RISING COSTS OR TO SHARE THE
BURDEN FAIRLY.
THE GROWING EXPENSE OF SUBSIDISING HEALTH
CARE PROMPTED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO
APPOINT A COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO HOSPITAL
COSTS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT HALF THE NATIONAL
HEALTH BILL. THE JAMISON COMMITTEE HAS
CONFIRMED THAT THE OVER-SUPPLY OF MEDICAL
SERVICES RATHER THAN EXCESSIVE DEMAND BY
PATIENTS IS THE MAIN FACTOR BEHIND SOARING COSTS.
THERE ARE TOO MANY DOCTORS (OVERALL AND
PARTICULARLY IN SOME SPECIALITIES), TOO MANY
HOSPITAL BEDS (OVERALL AND PARTICULARLY IN SOME
STATES) AND TOO MUCH USE OF EXPENSIVE MEDICAL
TECHNOLOGY. THERE IS, AS THE COMMITTEE WAS TOLD
BY THE COMMONWEALTH HEALTH DEPARTMENT, AN
"OVER-CONCENTRATION OF ACUTE CURATIVE SERVICES
AND AN INSUFFICIENT ATTENTION TO ILLNESS PREVENTION
AND REHABILITATION" WITH THE RESULT THAT "TOO
MANY PEOPLE ARE TREATED FOR TOO LONG IN AN
EXPENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT".
THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT, WHICH HAS BEEN
HANDED TO FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS BUT
NOT YET PUBLISHED, MAKES WIDE-RANGING
RECOMMENDATIONS TO RATIONALISE HOSPITAL FUNDING
AND SERVICES, AND TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL CONTROLS
AND EFFICIENCY. THERE IS CERTAINLY SCOPE FOR
SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS. THE REPORT POINTS OUT THAT
ALMOST $1000 MILLION A YEAR COULD BE SAVED IF
THE BEST ASPECTS OF THE VICTORIAN AND
QUEENSLAND HOSPITAL SYSTEMS WERE ADOPTED
THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA. BUT SUCH ECONOMIES WOULD
MEET POWERFUL RESISTANCE FROM STATE, REGIONAL
AND PROFESSIONAL INTERESTS. AND EVEN IF ADOPTED,
THEY WOULD NOT BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR A CRITICAL
REVIEW OF DOCTOR NUMBERS, THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE
SYSTEM AND THE PRIVATE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE IN
PUBLIC HOSPITALS. THE GOVERNMENT MUST ALSO
REALISE THAT THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT PRIORITIES
IN HEALTH CARE THAN THE PURSUIT OF COMPETITIVE
HEALTH INSURANCE AND FREEDOM OF CHOICE.
ALTHOUGH THE JAMISON COMMITTEE WAS NOT
ASKED TO ADDRESS ITSELF TO THE QUESTION OF HOW
THE COST BURDEN SHOULD BE SHARED BY THE
COMMUNITY, IT HAS MADE THE NOVEL SUGGESTION
THAT ANY FREE SERVICE RECEIVED BY AN UNINSURED
PERSON AT A PUBLIC HOSPITAL SHOULD BE REGARDED
AS AN INCOME BENEFIT AND TAXED ACCORDINGLY.
ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PRESENT
GOVERNMENT'S CHANGES TO THE HEALTH INSURANCE
SYSTEM HAS BEEN TO DISCOURAGE AN INCREASING
NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM INSURING PRIVATELY, THUS
MAKING IT MORE AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE
DWINDLING NUMBER OF HIGH RISK AND HIGH USE
CONTRIBUTORS. THE JAMISON PROPOSAL IS PREFERABLE
TO A RETURN TO THE PRE-MEDIBANK ERA OF A MEANS
TEST FOR FREE PUBLIC HOSPITAL TREATMENT. BUT A
MORE SENSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO RECOGNISE
THE MEDIBANK PRINCIPLE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD
CONTRIBUTE TO A CENTRAL HEALTH FUND ACCORDING TO
HIS MEANS AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO
BASIC HEALTH CARE ACCORDING TO HIS NEEDS. IN A
SUBMISSION TO THE JAMISON COMMITTEE, PROFESSOR
LOUIS OPIT DEVELOPED THIS CONCEPT BY
DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN ESSENTIAL "PUBLIC UTILITY"
MEDICINE, WHICH SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AT LITTLE OR
NO CHARGE TO EVERYONE, AND ELECTIVE "PRIVATE
CONSUMPTION" MEDICINE, WHICH SHOULD BE LEFT
WHOLLY TO PRIVATE PRACTICE AND INSURANCE WITHOUT
PUBLIC SUBSIDY. THE OPIT PROPOSAL, OR A MODIFIED
VERSION OF IT, WOULD COME CLOSER TO MEETING THE
THREE VITAL CRITERIA OF A GOOD HEALTH SCHEME THAN
THE TINKERING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SO FAR
UNDERTAKEN AND CONTEMPLATED, MORE IN DEFERENCE
TO IDEOLOGICAL PREJUDICES AND VESTED INTERESTS
THAN TO RATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PRIORITIES.

THURSDAY 15 JANUARY 1981
"DRAMA IN THE KNESSET"
IF MR MENACHEM BEGIN'S GOVERNMENT CAN
STRUGGLE ON UNTIL JUNE, PERHAPS THROUGH A
DISSOLUTION OF THE KNESSET, THE PRIME MINISTER
WILL BECOME THE FIRST ISRAELI LEADER TO SERVE AN
UNINTERRUPTED FOUR YEARS IN OFFICE. MR BEGIN HAS
ALREADY EARNED A REPUTATION AS THE COUNTRY'S
MOST ADROIT POLITICAL SURVIVOR. ANYONE WHO
SPENDS 29 YEARS IN OPPOSITION, AS MR BEGIN DID
BEFORE HIS UNEXPECTED WIN IN THE 1977 ELECTION,
WILL BE LOATHE TO SURRENDER POWER WITHOUT A
PASSIONATE FIGHT. WHATEVER HIS POLICIES, AND
DESPITE ABIDING ILL-HEALTH, THE LEADER OF THE
RIGHT-WING LIKUD COALITION HAS CONFOUNDED HIS
OPPONENTS AT EVERY TURN AND SURVIVED A SCORE
OF NO-CONFIDENCE MOTIONS ON THE SLENDEREST OF
MARGINS. HE RODE OUT THE RESIGNATIONS OF MR
DAYAN AND MR WEIZMAN. NOW MR HURVITZ HAS
BECOME THE SECOND LIKUD FINANCE MINISTER TO
RESIGN, AND WITHOUT HIS FACTION'S THREE VOTES
THERE IS NO MAJORITY.
SO ISRAEL, A NATION WHERE VIRTUALLY EVERY
GOVERNMENT HAS RESIGNED OR BEEN RECONSTITUTED
IN THE HEAT OF CRISIS, IS TO PREPARE FOR A MID-YEAR
ELECTION. IF IT IS ANY COMFORT TO THE COALITION
- AND PARTICULARLY TO MINISTERS SUCH AS MR
SHARON, WHO SEES EVERY EXTRA DAY IN OFFICE AS
AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ANOTHER SETTLEMENT IN
THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES - IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO
GO TO THE COUNTRY BEFORE NOVEMBER IN ANY
EVENT. SINCE THE OPINION POLLS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR THAT THE COALITION WOULD
REQUIRE ALMOST AN ACT OF GOD TO SAVE IT FROM
ITSELF AND THE ELECTORATE, THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING
TO INDUCE MR BEGIN TO TAKE HIS CHANCES OR EVEN
TO GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF RESIGNING THIS WEEK
AND FORMING A CARETAKER ADMINISTRATION. WHEN
POLLING DAY ARRIVES, NO MATTER WHAT THE DATE,
ANYTHING LESS THAN A RESOUNDING VICTORY WILL
COME AS A SURPRISE TO THE LABOR PARTY.
ON THE FACE OF IT, MR BEGIN'S UNDOING WAS
THE EDUCATION CONTROVERSY AND THREATS OF
RESIGNATION FROM BOTH THE FINANCE MINISTER (NO
WAGE INCREASE FOR TEACHERS) AND THE EDUCATION
MINISTER (WAGE INCREASES OF UP TO 60 PER CENT).
IN FACT IT IS THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL THAT IS THE
OVERRIDING ISSUE. INFLATION IS AT A MONSTROUS
LEVEL, AND NOT EVEN PROTECTION THROUGH
INDEXATION FOR THE COUNTRY'S CONSUMERS HAS KEPT
THE GOVERNMENT FROM ITS DECLINE IN THE OPINION
POLLS. PUBLIC CONFIDENCE HAS EBBED, PARTLY AS A
RESULT OF POLITICAL ACTS OF FOLLY SUCH AS THE EAST
JERUSALEM BILL AND THE COALITION'S IMAGE AS AN
INCREASINGLY QUARRELSOME AND INEFFECTIVE
GROUPING. BUT COULD A LABOR GOVERNMENT DO
MUCH BETTER?
CERTAINLY THE PARTY IS NOT AS DIVIDED AS IT
WAS BEFORE MR PERES SURVIVED ANOTHER CHALLENGE
TO HIS LEADERSHIP BY MR RABIN, THE FORMER
PRIME MINISTER. ITS MORE MODERATE SETTLEMENT
POLICIES (NO NEW SETTLEMENTS IN HEAVILY ARAB
AREAS AND THE ABOLITION OF CERTAIN EXISTING
SETTLEMENTS) HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL APPEAL. IT
SHARES WITH PRESIDENT-ELECT REAGAN A PENCHANT
FOR THE SO-CALLED JORDANIAN OPTION. THIS WOULD
ENCOURAGE KING HUSSEIN TO JOIN IN AN AUTONOMY
PLAN FOR PALESTINIANS IN ISRAELI-OCCUPIED AREAS
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE CAMP DAVID
AGREEMENTS, AND PERHAPS RESCUE THE ACCORDS
FROM A POLITICAL SWAMP.
BUT COULD LABOR DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE
ECONOMY? THERE ARE PLANS TO FREEZE WAGES AND
PRICES AND TO TAKE A SWING AT THE OVERFILLED
RANKS OF THE CIVIL SERVICE. GOVERNMENT SPENDING
MUST BE CUT, IT SAYS. THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT MR
BEGIN'S GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO, EVEN
IN THE PREVIOUSLY UNTHINKABLE AREA OF DEFENCE.
MR HURWITZ, AFTER ALL, RESIGNED OVER LIKUD'S
INABILITY TO CONTAIN THE WAGES PUSH, FEARING THAT
IF THE TEACHERS COULD WIN A RISE THEN EVERYONE
ELSE WOULD WANT ONE, TOO. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT
MR PERES WOULD NOT HAVE TO ATTEND TO THE
MULTI-FACTIONAL INTERESTS OF A LIKUD COALITION.
FOR THIS REASON A LABOR GOVERNMENT WOULD SEEM
TO STAND A BETTER CHANCE OF REDUCING INFLATION TO
DOUBLE FIGURES.
IN THE END, OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM IS THE
SAME: HOW TO RUN AN ECONOMY WHEN A THIRD OF
THE BUDGET HAS TO BE CREAMED OFF FOR DEFENCE
AND ANOTHER THIRD TO SERVICE THE FOREIGN DEBT.
THIS YEAR, TOO, IN A WORLD WHICH MANY ISRAELIS
SEE AS INCREASINGLY HOSTILE, ABOUT $2500 MILLION
WILL HAVE TO BE FOUND FOR OIL IMPORTS. ISRAELIS
RIGHT ACROSS PARTY LINES CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT
THEY SEE AS INDIFFERENCE TO THEIR PROBLEMS IN A
WEST THAT IS INCREASINGLY NERVOUS ABOUT ITS OIL
SUPPLY FROM THE ARABS. PERHAPS THE MOST
SIGNIFICANT REASON FOR THIS RENEWED FEELING OF
ISOLATION HAS BEEN MR BEGIN'S GOVERNMENT ITSELF.
MR BEGIN, THROUGH HIS COALITION CONTORTIONS, HAS
ARRIVED AT PROPOSALS AND UNILATERAL ACTIONS WHICH
MAKE IT PLAIN THAT HE HAS NO INTENTION OF GIVING
THE PALESTINIANS GENUINE AUTONOMY AND THAT HE
REGARDS THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK AND JERUSALEM
AS PART OF ISRAEL FOR EVER. THERE HAS BEEN A
RECENT RUTHLESSNESS ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH
CONTROVERSIAL POLICIES HAVE BEEN ENFORCED. THE
LIMITED ACHIEVEMENTS OF CAMP DAVID ARE
WASTING FOR LACK OF NOURISHMENT. THE EUPHORIA
OF THE ISRAELI-EGYPTIAN PEACE TREATY IS SOURING,
PARTICULARLY AT THE CAIRO END OF THE ROAD.
SO ISRAEL'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS INEVITABLY
COME BACK TO POLITICAL PROBLEMS. AND WHILE
LABOR'S STYLE IS MORE PRAGMATIC, ON AT LEAST
THREE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IT IS CLEAR THAT IN
SUBSTANCE THE OPPOSITION DOES NOT DIFFER
MARKEDLY FROM LIKUD. NEITHER ENTERTAINS A
RETURN TO THE PRE-1967 BORDERS OR A PALESTINIAN
STATE OR A DIVIDED JERUSALEM. IF LABOR TAKES
OFFICE THIS YEAR, THEREFORE, THE ABRASIVENESS AND
PROVOCATION OF THE BEGIN YEARS ARE LIKELY TO
DISAPPEAR, BUT MR PERES AND HIS COLLEAGUES WILL
BE EVERY BIT AS TOUGH ABOUT DEFENDING WHAT THEY
SEE AS ISRAEL'S VITAL INTERESTS. THE ARAB WORLD
MIGHT APPEAR TO BE HOPELESSLY DIVIDED AT THIS
TIME, BUT THE ISRAELIS FEEL JUST AS THREATENED AS
EVER. THERE WILL BE NO COMPROMISE ON SECURITY,
NO MATTER WHO HAS A MAJORITY IN THE KNESSET.
"CURE NEEDED FOR FAIRFIELD'S ILLS"
SOMETHING IS AMISS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION
OF FAIRFIELD HOSPITAL. SEVEN SENIOR DOCTORS
AT THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES HOSPITAL AND TWO
PROFESSORS ON ITS BOARD HAVE ALL TENDERED THEIR
RESIGNATIONS. ONE OF THE TWO PROFESSORS WHO
QUIT THE BOARD SAYS THE DOCTORS' RESIGNATIONS
WOULD MEAN THAT FAIRFIELD WOULD LOSE "THE BEST
VIROLOGY SET-UP IN AUSTRALIA AND ONE OF THE BEST
IN THE WORLD". IT IS A PROSPECT THAT SHOULD HAVE
SHOCKED THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT INTO ACTION
LONG BEFORE NOW. ON TUESDAY NIGHT THEY ACTUALLY
WENT AS FAR AS INVITING THE RESIGNING DOCTORS TO
EXTEND THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THEIR DEPARTURE TO
31 MARCH. OTHERWISE THE CRISIS IS NOT MUCH
CLOSER TO A SOLUTION.
THIS IS A THOROUGHLY UNSATISFACTORY STATE OF
AFFAIRS. THE TROUBLE FIRST FLARED-UP PUBLICLY LAST
APRIL. THE THEN OMBUDSMAN, SIR JOHN DILLON,
WHO WAS CALLED IN TO EXAMINE THE DISPUTE, WAS
CRITICAL OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STYLE OF THE
HOSPITAL'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND MEDICAL
DIRECTOR, DR NOEL BENNETT. HE SAID DR BENNETT
WAS A DEDICATED, HARD-WORKING AND COMPETENT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WHO HAD GREATLY IMPROVED
THE HOSPITAL'S ADMINISTRATION. BUT HE ALSO SAID
DR BENNETT LACKED SENSITIVITY AND TACT, AND THAT
THERE WAS A LACK OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN THE STAFF AND THE HOSPITAL BOARD OF
MANAGEMENT, AND THAT THIS HAD CONTRIBUTED TO A
STATE OF TENSION AND LOW STAFF MORALE FOR MONTHS.
THE TENSIONS AND THE LOW STAFF MORALE
OBVIOUSLY PERSIST. FOR THE SAKE OF PRESENT AND
FUTURE PATIENTS AT THE HOSPITAL, THIS CANNOT BE
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. IF THE BOARD CANNOT DIAGNOSE
THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE AND APPLY A REMEDY
ITSELF, THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH, MR BORTHWICK,
SHOULD STEP IN PROMPTLY AND EXERCISE HIS
AUTHORITY. FAIRFIELD CAN ILL AFFORD TO LOSE DOCTORS
OF THE CALIBRE AND STANDING OF THE SEVEN WHO
HAVE GIVEN NOTICE.
<F83>
FRIDAY 16 JANUARY 1981
"B-52 DILEMMA: TIME TO RETHINK"
THE FRASER GOVERNMENT'S EAGERNESS TO OFFER
THE UNITED STATES DEFENCE FACILITIES IN
AUSTRALIA SEEMS TO BE DEVELOPING INTO AN
EMBARRASSMENT FOR BOTH COUNTRIES. THE PRIME
MINISTER'S GESTURE OF SOLIDARITY WITH A POWERFUL
FRIEND AND ALLY AT THE TIME OF THE SOVIET INVASION
OF AFGHANISTAN WAS SOON TAKEN UP. LAST
FEBRUARY B-52 BOMBERS APPEARED REGULARLY ON
TRAINING RUNS OVER CAPE YORK WITHOUT TOUCHING
GROUND, AND IN JULY US AIR FORCE OFFICIALS
ARRIVED TO ASSESS THE SUITABILITY OF AUSTRALIA'S
NORTHERN AIRFIELDS FOR USE BY THE GIANT AIRCRAFT.
IN SEPTEMBER MR FRASER ANNOUNCED THAT THE
UNITED STATES HAD REQUESTED AN AGREEMENT FOR
THE STAGING OF B-52S THROUGH AUSTRALIA AND
OUTLINED THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S CONDITIONS
FOR ALLOWING SUCH FLIGHTS.
IN CONTRAST TO SOME PREVIOUS AUSTRALIAN
LEADERS' UNCRITICAL DEFERENCE TO AMERICAN
PRIORITIES OR NAIVE ATTEMPTS TO LOCK THE UNITED
STATES INTO UNDERWRITING AUSTRALIA'S SECURITY,
MR FRASER INSISTED ON CONDITIONS TO UPHOLD
AUSTRALIAN SOVEREIGN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL
INTERESTS. HE IMPLIED THAT B-52 AIRCRAFT WOULD
BE WELCOME, AS THE AMERICANS HAD SOUGHT, TO
USE AUSTRALIAN AIRSPACE FOR LOW-LEVEL TRAINING
FLIGHTS AND TO TAKE-OFF FROM AUSTRALIAN AIRFIELDS
FOR SURVEILLANCE OVER THE INDIAN OCEAN. HOWEVER,
HE SAID, ANY OTHER PROPOSED OPERATIONS WOULD
REQUIRE "FULL CONSULTATION" AND "PRIOR CONSENT",
AND AUSTRALIA WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE
TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF ANY US
OPERATIONS MOUNTED FROM AUSTRALIA. IN PARTICULAR,
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE
CONSULTED IF ANY AIRCRAFT ARMED WITH NUCLEAR
WEAPONS WERE TO FLY OVER OR STAGE THROUGH
AUSTRALIA. SUCH INFORMATION WOULD NOT BE MADE
PUBLIC.
THE TERMS PROPOSED BY THE PRIME MINISTER
WERE, FROM AUSTRALIA'S POINT OF VIEW, PERFECTLY
PROPER AND REASONABLE FOR A SELF-RESPECTING
INDEPENDENT NATION TO SEEK. AUSTRALIA DOES HAVE
AN INTEREST IN HELPING THE UNITED STATES MAINTAIN
THE STRATEGIC BALANCE OF POWER AGAINST THE
SOVIET UNION, ESPECIALLY IN THE INDIAN OCEAN
REGION. BUT AUSTRALIAN INTERESTS DO NOT ALWAYS
COINCIDE WITH THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES IN
OTHER CONFLICTS. THIS COUNTRY MAY NOT, FOR
INSTANCE, WISH TO BE USED AS A STAGING POST IN
THE EVENT OF WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. AND
WHETHER AUSTRALIA SHOULD BE USED AS A BASE
FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS A MATTER ON WHICH ITS
GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO HAVE A PRIOR SAY.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHAT AUSTRALIA IS
ENTITLED IN PRINCIPLE TO SEEK IN SUCH AN
AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE WHAT IN PRACTICE IT CAN
REALISTICALLY EXPECT THE UNITED STATES TO ACCEPT.
IN RETROSPECT, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT NO FINAL
AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED AFTER SEVERAL
MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS OR, DESPITE CANBERRA'S
CONFIDENCE THAT THE TERMS WERE ACCEPTABLE TO
THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION, THAT WASHINGTON
SHOULD NOW HAVE DEFERRED FURTHER CONSIDERATION
UNTIL THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION TAKES OVER.
AMERICAN OFFICIALS APPEAR TO HAVE REALISED THAT
THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE UNLIKELY
TO AGREE TO THE LIMITATIONS ON THE DEPLOYMENT
OF AMERICAN MILITARY MIGHT DEMANDED BY A
MINOR ALLY. AMERICAN POLICY HAS BEEN NEITHER
TO CONFIRM NOR DENY, EVEN ON A STRICT
GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT LEVEL, WHETHER
NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE CARRIED ON ITS SHIPS OR
AIRCRAFT. IT WOULD BE SURPRISING IF THE REAGAN
ADMINISTRATION WERE TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR
AUSTRALIA.
WHATEVER THE REAL REASON FOR THE HITCH IN
NEGOTIATIONS, IT MAKES SENSE FOR A DECISION ON
SUCH A SENSITIVE ISSUE TO BE LEFT TO THE NEW
ADMINISTRATION. THE AMERICANS MUST ALSO BE
AWARE THAT, WHILE THE PRESENT AUSTRALIAN
GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT OBJECT TO THE NON-
OPERATIONAL CARRIAGE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS THROUGH
AUSTRALIA, THE LABOR PARTY HAS DECLARED THAT IF
IN POWER IT WOULD NOT ALLOW NUCLEAR WEAPONS
TO BE BROUGHT HERE. THE DEFERRAL OF NEGOTIATIONS
SHOULD BE SEEN BY CANBERRA NOT AS A
DISAPPOINTMENT BUT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR
REASSESSMENT OF AUSTRALIA'S BENEFITS, RISKS AND
OBLIGATIONS AS AN AMERICAN ALLY. THE AUSTRALIAN
GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT RETREAT FROM ITS
STRINGENT GUIDELINES FOR B-52 FLIGHTS OVER OR
THROUGH AUSTRALIA WITHOUT EXPLAINING THE
IMPLICATIONS TO THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC. THE ISSUES
AT STAKE ARE OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO THIS
COUNTRY, POSING POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE
IMPERATIVES OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND NATIONAL
SOVEREIGNTY.
"SUMMER ON THE RIVER"
SUMMER SHOULD BE THE BEST
SEASON FOR THE RIVER. WARM
WEATHER MAKES IT NATURAL TO BE
OUTDOORS; HOLIDAYS AND LONG
EVENINGS GIVE US TIME TO EXPLORE
THE WATERWAY RUNNING THROUGH THE CITY. THIS
IS THE TIME TO GO FOR A SWIM IN THE RIVER ON
A HOT DAY. THE TIME TO TAKE A CANOE OUT ON THE
WATER OR ENJOY A FERRY RIDE DOWN TO THE PORT OR
UPSTREAM TO THE BUSH. THE TIME TO HAVE PICNICS
BY THE RIVERSIDE AND EXPLORE ITS SECRETS BY FOOT
OR BIKE.
ALAS, PEOPLE IN MELBOURNE CANNOT YET DO
ALL THIS ON THE YARRA. THE WATER IS NOT YET
CLEAN ENOUGH FOR THE RIVER TO BE THE PLACE TO
GO FOR A SWIM ON SUMMER EVENINGS. THERE ARE
FEW BOATS ON THE RIVER APART FROM YARRA BEND.
THE PORT IS STILL LARGELY INACCESSIBLE TO THE
PEOPLE. THE PICNIC SITES ARE LIMITED, AND TRACKS
RUN ONLY INTERMITTENTLY ALONG THE RIVER'S BANKS.
BUT THIS SUMMER THERE ARE CHANGES. THANKS
TO MR HAMER AND SOME ENLIGHTENED CITY
COUNCILLORS, THE BULLDOZERS HAVE BEGUN SMASHING
UP THE CAR PARK ON THE CITY'S RIVER FRONTAGE IN
PREPARATION FOR THE LAND TO BE TRANSFORMED THIS
YEAR INTO BATMAN PARK. FURTHER UPSTREAM, WITH
THE ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT OF MR DIXON, A PATH IS
BEING CARVED OUT ALONGSIDE THE RIVER BETWEEN
GRANGE ROAD AND HAWTHORN BRIDGE AS A
CONTINUATION OF THE YARRA BIKE PATH. WHERE THE
PARKS AND BARBECUES ARE, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
ARE USING THEM. WITHIN SIX MONTHS A CO-ORDINATED
LANDSCAPE DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR THE RIVER SHOULD
BE READY TO BE PUT INTO ACTION.
THE PORT OF MELBOURNE AUTHORITY, FOR SO
LONG AN UNCARING LANDLORD, HAS NOW ALSO TO ITS
CREDIT COME UP WITH A PLAN TO OPEN UP THE VAST
PORT AREA AND TRANSFORM IT INTO AN ATTRACTIVE
PLACE. IN THE INITIAL PART OF THE PLAN, A $1 MILLION
MARITIME PARK WILL BE CREATED AROUND THE
NATIONAL TRUST'S HISTORIC BARQUE, THE 'POLLY
WOODSIDE' ON SOUTH WHARF. A SIMILAR AMOUNT
WILL ALSO BE SPENT LANDSCAPING NORTH WHARF IN
FRONT OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE, AND LANDSCAPING
THE BANKS OF THE MARIBYRNONG SOUTH OF FOOTSCRAY
ROAD.
AMID THIS REDISCOVERY OF THE YARRA, IT IS
GOOD TO SEE A SIMILAR RENAISSANCE ALONG THE
MARIBYRNONG. AS OUR WEEKENDER MAGAZINE
RECOUNTED LAST WEEK, MELBOURNE'S SECOND RIVER
IS ALSO DEVELOPING INTO A FOCUS OF SUMMER LIFE
FOR THE WESTERN SUBURBS. THE WATERWAY ONCE
SCORNED AS A POLLUTED DRAIN IS NOW COMING ALIVE
WITH FISH, RESTAURANTS, BOATS AND PARKS. PEOPLE
ARE PICNICKING AT BRIMBANK PARK AND ORGAN
PIPES NATIONAL PARK, TAKING WEEKEND RIVER
CRUISES, AND GOING CANOEING OR JOGGING ALONG THE
ONCE FORGOTTEN RIVER OF THE WEST.
THIS IS AS IT SHOULD BE. MELBOURNE IS A CITY
WITH FEW LANDSCAPE ASSETS. OUR RIVERS, STREAMS
AND BEACHES ARE THE BEST NATURAL FEATURES WE
HAVE. WE SHOULD MAKE THE MOST OF THEM - AND
KEEP PRESSING THE STATE GOVERNMENT, BOARD OF
WORKS AND OUR COUNCILS TO DEVELOP RIVERSIDE
PARKS SO THAT WE CAN DO SO. THE YARRA IS THE
HEART OF A POTENTIALLY BEAUTIFUL CITY.
<F84>
SATURDAY 17 JANUARY 1981
"THE FUTURE OF MELBOURNE"
THE STATE GOVERNMENT PROPOSES TO TAKE
LONGER THAN SEEMS NECESSARY OR DESIRABLE
TO REFORM THE MELBOURNE CITY COUNCIL.
COMMENDABLY, IT WILL STAND BY ITS DECISION TO
DISMISS THE PRESENT 26-MEMBER COUNCIL AND
REPLACE IT WITH THREE ADMINISTRATORS UNTIL A
RESTRUCTURED COUNCIL CAN BE ELECTED.
COMMENDABLY, TOO, IT IS PREPARED TO
RECONSIDER ITS PLAN TO CONFINE THE CITY LIMITS TO
THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT. BUT WHY SHOULD
IT TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR TO REDEFINE THE CITY
BOUNDARIES? AND WHY ARE THE ADMINISTRATORS
WHO ARE TO TAKE OVER RESPONSIBILITY IN APRIL
EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN OFFICE FOR TWO TO THREE
YEARS? THE PRESENT COUNCIL'S INCOMPETENCE
JUSTIFIES ITS REPLACEMENT, BUT SURELY THE MESS
CAN BE CLEANED UP MORE QUICKLY THAN THAT.
THE ADMINISTRATORS, YET UNNAMED, WILL HAVE
THREE MAIN DUTIES. UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S
REVISED PLAN, ONE WILL BE TO RECOMMEND NEW
BOUNDARIES AFTER HEARING SUBMISSIONS FROM CIVIC,
RESIDENTIAL, BUSINESS AND UNION REPRESENTATIVES.
THIS SHOULD NOT TAKE LONG. THE GOVERNMENT NOW
HAS DECIDED, AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THAT THE
CITY SHOULD COVER SOME INNER RESIDENTIAL AREAS
AND PARKS AND GARDENS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL
BUSINESS DISTRICT, BUT NOT THE MORE OUTLYING
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS WITHIN THE PRESENT
BOUNDARIES. THIS IS SENSIBLE; THE NEW CITY
COUNCIL SHOULD NOT BE BASED SOLELY ON BUSINESS,
CHIEFLY RETAIL, INTERESTS. BUT INTERESTED
GROUPS WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO PREPARE THEIR
SUBMISSIONS BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATORS TAKE OVER.
AND THE EFFECT OF HIVING OFF MOST OF THE CITY'S
PRESENT RESIDENTIAL AREAS CAN BE CALCULATED IN
ADVANCE, TOO. IF RELEVANT INFORMATION AND
OPINION IS ASSEMBLED OVER THE NEXT THREE
MONTHS, THEN THE ADMINISTRATORS SHOULD BE ABLE
TO REDRAW THE CITY MAP FAIRLY SOON.
THE SECOND DUTY OF THE ADMINISTRATORS WILL
BE TO STUDY THE CITY'S COMPLEX FINANCIAL AND
ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE, AND TO RECOMMEND
REFORMS. A FEW MONTHS' EXPERIENCE IN OFFICE
SHOULD BE ENOUGH, ESPECIALLY IF THE
ADMINISTRATORS ARE CHOSEN FOR THEIR EXPERTISE IN
PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AND TOWN PLANNING. ONE PROBLEM THAT THE
GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO HAVE OVERLOOKED IS THAT
OF THE FRANCHISE. ALL ADULT RESIDENTS ARE TO HAVE
THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN OTHER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS,
AND RIGHTLY SO. BUT THE CITY OF MELBOURNE
DIFFERS IN THAT IT HAS RELATIVELY FEW RESIDENTS,
AND WILL HAVE FEWER STILL UNDER THE PROPOSED
REDUCTION. THE NEW COUNCIL SHOULD NOT BE
ELECTED PREDOMINANTLY BY BUSINESS INTERESTS. THE
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WORK AND SHOP IN THE
CITY DESERVE REPRESENTATION, TOO.
THE ADMINISTRATORS' THIRD DUTY WILL BE TO
RUN THE CITY UNTIL A NEW COUNCIL IS ELECTED. HERE
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEIR ROLE SHOULD BE
SIMPLY THAT OF CARETAKERS AND CONSULTANTS, OR
WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO MAKE
MORE SUBSTANTIVE POLICY DECISIONS AFFECTING THE
CITY'S FUTURE. AS A MATTER OF DEMOCRATIC
PRINCIPLE, FAR-REACHING POLICY DECISIONS OUGHT TO
BE MADE BY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES RATHER THAN
BY APPOINTED ADMINISTRATORS. BUT THE
ADMINISTRATORS, WHATEVER THE SCOPE OF THEIR
POWERS, WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE MINISTER FOR
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THROUGH HIM TO A
RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT. PROVIDED THE
ADMINISTRATORS ARE OF THE HIGHEST CALIBRE, AND
PROVIDED THAT POLICY DECISIONS ARE SUBJECT TO
GOVERNMENT APPROVAL, THEN THE OPPORTUNITY
SHOULD NOT BE LOST TO APPLY SOME FRESH IDEAS
AND EXPERTISE TO RESOLVING THE CITY'S PLANNING
PROBLEMS. AFTER ALL, THE CITY CANNOT STAND STILL
WHILE THE COUNCIL STRUCTURE IS REFORMED. THE
INTERREGNUM SHOULD BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE, BUT
IF SOMETHING OF VALUE BEYOND A NEW
ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE CAN BE ACHIEVED, SO
MUCH THE BETTER.
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
THE 17TH CENTURY TAJ MAHAL IS IN DANGER OF
BEING RAVAGED BY POLLUTION. TOXIC WASTES
FROM AN OIL REFINERY, MORE RECENTLY BUILT NEARBY,
ARE ATTACKING THE ENAMEL-LIKE SURFACE OF THE
MARBLE. CONTINUED ACRID FUMES, EXPERTS SAY,
ULTIMATELY COULD CHANGE THE TAJ'S GLEAMING
WHITENESS TO THE DRAB COLOR OF CONCRETE.
THIS DIM PROSPECT CONCERNS MORE THAN THE
INDIANS, WHO VIEW THE TAJ MAHAL AS BOTH A
VENERABLE MONUMENT AND A VALUABLE TOURIST
ATTRACTION. LIKE THE LEANING TOWER OF PISA, THE
PYRAMIDS AND THE MONA LISA, THIS FAMOUS
MEMORIAL TO THE WIFE OF MOGUL EMPEROR SHAH
JAHAN NOW BELONGS TO THE WORLD. VISITORS FROM
EVERY COUNTRY MUST HAVE ADMIRED IT; MILLIONS
WHO HAVE NOT THEMSELVES VIEWED IT CARRY A
MENTAL PICTURE OF ITS FINELY SCULPTURED SPLENDOR.
WORLD-WIDE PROTESTS ARE BEING VOICED ABOUT
THE THREAT TO THE FUTURE OF THIS ARCHITECTURAL
WONDER, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE ROYAL AUSTRALIAN
INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS DIRECTED TO THE INDIAN
HIGH COMMISSIONER IN CANBERRA.
DEFENDERS OF THE REFINERY, PREDICTABLY, STRESS
THE IMPORTANCE OF OIL TO WORLD ECONOMY, AND
THE THREAT OF 1100 JOBS IF ACTION IS TAKEN AGAINST
ITS OPERATIONS.
THIS AFFAIR RAISES A QUESTION FAR WIDER THAN
THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF MARBLE AND OIL, THE
TAJ MAHAL AND THE MATHURA REFINERY. THAT IS
BUT ONE INSTANCE OF A DILEMMA THAT CONSTANTLY
FACES MODERN SOCIETY: THE FREQUENT NEED TO
CHOOSE BETWEEN LIFE'S PRACTICAL NECESSITIES AND
ITS AESTHETIC VALUES; ITS ECONOMY, AND BEAUTY;
THE COMMERCIAL AND THE MONUMENTAL.
SIMILAR QUESTIONS ARISE OVER DIFFERENT ISSUES
IN DIFFERENT PLACES. IT AROSE WHEN PLANS FOR THE
ALBURY - WODONGA DEVELOPMENT WERE FIRST
RELEASED. SOME CRITICS ATTACKED THE "WASTE" OF
PUBLIC FUNDS ON HECTARES OF HILLS WHICH, THEY
POINTED OUT, WERE QUITE UNSUITABLE FOR BUILDING
SITES.
BUT IS THE VALUE OF GREEN HILLS TO AN
ENVIRONMENT TO BE ASSESSED ONLY BY THEIR
POTENTIAL FOR HOUSING? THE PLANNERS OF CANBERRA
ALSO RESERVED MANY HECTARES OF HILLS THAT
DEVELOPERS WILL NEVER STRIPE WITH ROADS NOR
CARVE UP INTO BUILDING LOTS. LIKE THE ALBURY-
WODONGA HILLS, THEY WERE DESIGNED TO BE, AND
ARE, PICTURESQUE BACKDROPS TO GRACE THE ENVIRONS
OF CANBERRA AND ITS SUBURBS, AND A SOURCE OF
PLEASURE TO BOTH THE RESIDENTS AND ALL WHO VISIT
THE NATIONAL CAPITAL.
OVER RECENT YEARS HUNDREDS OF HECTARES OF THE
DANDENONGS HAVE BEEN DENUDED AS DEVELOPERS
HAVE BULLDOZED WOODED MOUNTAIN SLOPES AND
SYLVAN FERN GULLIES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
PRESERVED FOR THE DELECTATION OF THE WHOLE
COMMUNITY. THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT IS TO BE
ENCOURAGED IN ITS "BUY-BACK" POLICY, ALBEIT
BELATED, TO PRESERVE MORE OF WHAT REMAINS.
PRESSURE NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED FOR BROAD
AND LONG-RANGE PLANNING TO AVOID THREATS TO
NATURAL BEAUTY, AND MORE RIGID CONTROLS OVER
SOURCES OF POLLUTION THAT WOULD DAMAGE
ARCHITECTURAL SPLENDORS.
SUCH MEASURES COST MONEY. BUT WHAT WE
SPEND MONEY ON IS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF
PRIORITIES. WE NEED LIFE'S AESTHETIC AS WELL AS
ITS PRACTICAL ELEMENTS, ITS BEAUTY AS WELL AS ITS
BUSINESS, ITS ARCHITECTURAL GEMS AS WELL AS OIL,
ITS ETERNAL AND SPIRITUAL VALUES AS WELL AS THOSE
THAT ARE PASSING AND MATERIAL.
<F85>
MONDAY 19 JANUARY 1981
"WHY BLAME THE VICTIMS?"
ONE OF OUR UGLIEST REACTIONS TO THE SUFFERING
OF OTHERS IS A TENDENCY TO BLAME THE
VICTIMS FOR THEIR OWN MISFORTUNE. YOU FIND IT
WHEN MATERIALLY COMFORTABLE AUSTRALIANS ARE
CONFRONTED BY THE DESPERATE POVERTY OF PEOPLE
IN COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA. YOU FIND IT WHEN WHITE
AUSTRALIANS ARE CONFRONTED BY THE MISERY OF THE
DISPOSSESSED BLACKS, OR WHEN MEN ARE CONFRONTED
BY THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF WOMEN. AND YOU
FIND IT WHEN OLDER AUSTRALIANS WITH SECURE JOBS
ARE CONFRONTED BY THE FACT THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF TEENAGERS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE NOW UNEMPLOYED.
THE FRASER GOVERNMENT HAS CONSTANTLY
ENCOURAGED AUSTRALIANS TO BELIEVE THAT THE
TEENAGE UNEMPLOYED ARE LARGELY COMPOSED OF
"DOLE BLUDGERS". ITS LEADERS FIRST USED THIS
RHETORIC IN OPPOSITION, AND CARRIED IT WITH THEM
INTO GOVERNMENT WHERE MR FRASER PROMISED TO
STOP PAYING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO "THOSE
WHO DON'T WANT TO WORK". (THE PLEDGE APPEARED
TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT, AS THE PROPORTION OF
THE UNEMPLOYED RECEIVING THE DOLE IN FACT
SUBSEQUENTLY ROSE.)
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE GOVERNMENT
HAS FROZEN THE BENEFIT FOR UNEMPLOYED 15 TO 17
YEAR OLDS AT $36 A WEEK, CLAIMING THAT TO PAY
ANYTHING MORE WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM NOT TO
LOOK FOR WORK. AND NOW TWO OF ITS MINISTERS
HAVE PUSHED THIS ATTITUDE TO ITS ULTIMATE BY
ANNOUNCING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERING
SCRAPPING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ALTOGETHER FOR
PEOPLE UNDER 18, IN A BID TO FORCE THEM TO
EITHER STAY AT SCHOOL OR FIND WORK.
IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT OLDER PEOPLE WHO
JOINED THE WORKFORCE WHEN JOBS WERE ABUNDANT
MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND THAT TODAY'S YOUNG FACE
A DIFFERENT SITUATION. BUT IT IS INEXCUSABLE THAT A
GOVERNMENT KNOWING THE FACTS SHOULD PERPETUATE
THE MYTH THAT TEENAGERS ARE UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE
THEY CHOOSE TO BE. THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT THEY
ARE UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH
JOBS FOR THEM. IN DECEMBER THERE WERE 430,000
AUSTRALIANS LOOKING FOR WORK. BUT AT THE SAME
TIME THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 30,000 JOBS LOOKING
FOR WORKERS. IN THIS SITUATION IT IS FUTILE TO BLAME
THE NEWCOMERS TO THE WORKFORCE IF THEY CANNOT
FIND JOBS.
NO DOUBT SOME OF THE 146,200 TEENAGE
UNEMPLOYED MIGHT BENEFIT FROM MORE SCHOOLING.
SOME MIGHT ALSO FIND WORK IF THEY LOOKED HARDER.
BUT MANY WOULD NOT BE BETTER OFF AT SCHOOL,
PARTICULARLY WHEN SCHOOLING IN YEARS 11 AND 12
IS NOT MAINLY DIRECTED TO JOB TRAINING. IT IS
ONE THING TO ENCOURAGE THE STATES TO PROVIDE
SECONDARY SCHOOLING THAT BETTER EQUIPS TEENAGERS
TO JOIN A SKILLED WORKFORCE. SOME VALUABLE PILOT
WORK IS BEING DONE IN THIS FIELD, BUT IT WILL BE
A LONG TIME BEFORE WIDESPREAD CHANGES ARE MADE.
TO CUT OFF EVERYONE UNDER 18 FROM THE DOLE ON
THIS EXCUSE WOULD CREATE EXTREME HARDSHIP FOR
THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED
THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN.
WHAT IS THE POINT OF BLAMING THE JOBLESS
WHEN THERE ARE 15 OF THEM FOR EVERY VACANT JOB?
THE GOVERNMENT MAY PROFESS WORTHY MOTIVES.
THE ACTION IT IS CONTEMPLATING, HOWEVER, IS A
MEAN AND CALLOUS ONE. IT WOULD BE LIKE ABOLISHING
PENSIONS FOR THE ELDERLY ON THE GROUNDS OF
"ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO SAVE FOR THEMSELVES",
BENEATH THE RHETORIC IS A HEARTLESS INDIFFERENCE
TO THOSE IN NEED. VICTORIA'S EMPLOYMENT MINISTER,
MR DIXON, WAS RIGHTLY QUICK TO REJECT THE
PROPOSAL. THE WHOLE OF AUSTRALIA SHOULD JOIN
HIM IN DOING SO.
"KEEP SKI VILLAGES BELOW THE SNOW"
SKIING IS ONE OF THE NEW BREED OF SPORTS
WHICH HAS GROWN RAPIDLY IN THIS AGE OF
INDIVIDUALISED RECREATION. ONCE A SPORT RESTRICTED
TO THE WEALTHY AND IMMIGRANT EUROPEANS, IT IS
GRADUALLY SPREADING TO A WIDE CONGREGATION OF
ENTHUSIASTS WHO ENJOY ITS CHALLENGE OF
NEGOTIATING STEEP SLOPES AT HIGH SPEED, OR GOING
FOR LONG TREKS ALONG SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAIN
RIDGES. BUT AS THE SPORT HAS GROWN, SO HAVE THE
DEMANDS IT MAKES ON PUBLIC LAND - AND ITS
CLAIMS ON THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY.
LAST WEEK'S DISCLOSURE OF PLANS FOR FUTURE
SKI DEVELOPMENT IN NEW SOUTH WALES AND
VICTORIA ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THE
GROWTH OF SKIING. THE NSW NATIONAL PARKS AND
WILDLIFE SERVICE IS REPORTED TO HAVE DRAFTED A
MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT WOULD ALLOW NO NEW SKI
VILLAGES IN THE KOSCIUSKO NATIONAL PARK, THE
HOME OF THE STATE'S SKIING. WHILE THREE NEW SKI
RESORTS IN THE PARK WOULD BE CREATED UNDER THE
PLAN, THEY WOULD CATER ONLY FOR DAY VISITORS.
SKIERS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO STAY IN VILLAGES
BELOW THE SNOWLINE, AND TRAVEL UP TO THE SNOW
EACH DAY BY BUS. THE SERVICE ARGUES THAT THIS
WOULD CREATE LESS ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE  THAN
VILLAGES ABOVE THE SNOWLINE, WHICH POSE
FORMIDABLE PROBLEMS FOR SEWERAGE, WATER SUPPLY,
ELECTRICITY, ROADS AND GARBAGE REMOVAL.
IN VICTORIA, BY CONTRAST, MR HAMER
ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR ONE NEW SKI VILLAGE AND
THE EXPANSION OF FOUR OTHERS - ALL OF THEM ABOVE
THE SNOWLINE. THE NEW VILLAGE WILL BE ON MOUNT
STIRLING, IMMEDIATELY EAST OF MOUNT BULLER.
ANOTHER NEW RESORT DESIGNED FOR DAY TRIPS WILL
BE DEVELOPED SOMEWHERE IN "THE NORTH-EAST OF
THE ALPS" - A LUDICROUS LOCATION, SINCE IT
WOULD BE FAR BEYOND THE REACH OF ANYONE LIVING
IN MELBOURNE. IN ADDITION, MR HAMER PROMISED
TO SPEND $8.3 MILLION IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS TO
DEVELOP THE EXISTING SKI VILLAGES AT MOUNT
BULLER, FALLS CREEK, MOUNT HOTHAM AND MOUNT
BAW BAW - A HUGE SUBSIDY COMPARED TO THAT
RECEIVED BY OTHER SPORTS, AND ONE THAT IS
UNLIKELY TO BE REPAID.
THE NEW SOUTH WALES PLAN APPEARS QUITE
THE WISER OF THE TWO. FIRST, BECAUSE SNOW-LEVEL
VILLAGES MAKE SKIING VERY EXPENSIVE, AS A
COMPARISON WITH NEW ZEALAND (WHERE THE
VILLAGES ARE BELOW THE SNOWLINE) MAKES CLEAR. IT
COSTS MONEY TO BRING ANYTHING UP THE MOUNTAIN,
AND CONSUMERS PAY FOR IT DEARLY. SECOND, THE
EXISTING RESORTS ENJOY A LARGE HIDDEN SUBSIDY
FROM THE TAXPAYERS - ONE THAT DWARFS THE
SUBSIDIES RECEIVED BY FAR MORE POPULAR SPORTS.
TAXPAYERS PAY TO BUILD THE EXPENSIVE MOUNTAIN
ROADS, TO MAINTAIN THEM, TO BRING ELECTRICITY
AND WATER, AND TAKE AWAY SEWAGE AND GARBAGE;
THE SKIERS REAP THE BENEFIT.
THIRD, VILLAGES ABOVE THE SNOWLINE RUIN THE
BEAUTY OF THE ALPS FOR OTHER VISITORS. PEOPLE
WHO HAVE COME TO THE MOUNTAINS IN OTHER
SEASONS TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL SHOULD NOT HAVE
THEIR ENJOYMENT SPOILED BY THE UGLY INTRUSION OF
ALPINE SUBURBIAS. SKIERS DO NOT NEED VILLAGES
ABOVE THE SNOWLINE; OTHERS DO NOT WANT THEM.
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD LEAVE THE SKI LODGES OFF
MOUNT STIRLING, PROVIDE SKI TOWS AND DAY
FACILITIES THERE, AND DEVELOP A VILLAGE INSTEAD
AT MIRIMBAH, THE SETTLEMENT AT THE FOOT OF BOTH
STIRLING AND BULLER. SOMETIMES IT IS BETTER TO
BEND TO NATURE THAN TO DEFY IT.

TUESDAY 20 JANUARY 1981
"FREEDOM FOR THE HOSTAGES"
THE IMMINENT RELEASE OF THE AMERICAN
HOSTAGES IS A CAUSE FOR RELIEF AND REJOICING.
IT WILL ALSO BE SEEN, WITH SOME JUSTIFICATION, AS
A VINDICATION OF PRESIDENT CARTER'S TACTICS,
WHICH, ONE TRAGIC DEBACLE ASIDE, WERE RESTRAINED
AND REASONED IN THE FACE OF THE ILLOGICAL AND
THE PROVOCATIVE. A STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN
SAID YESTERDAY: "THE BASIC EXCHANGE IS WE'RE
GETTING BACK FROM THEM WHAT THEY TOOK FROM
US AND GIVING BACK TO THEM WHAT WE TOOK FROM
THEM, AS A RESULT". THIS IS A GLOSS ON THE
AFFAIR: ACCURATE IF ARITHMETIC CAN BE ACCEPTED
WHICH EQUATES 52 HOSTAGES WITH $6756 MILLION
WORTH OF FROZEN IRANIAN ASSETS; UNDERSTANDABLE,
GIVEN THE DESIRE OF A PROUD SUPERPOWER TO
MINIMISE HUMILIATION AT THE HANDS OF RAG-TAG
REVOLUTIONARIES.
BUT WHEN THE HOSTAGES ARE HOME, THE
YELLOW RIBBONS ARE UNTIED AND SHAKY BRIDGES ARE
REBUILT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND IRAN, A
BASIC FACT WILL REMAIN: INCALCULABLE DAMAGE WAS
DONE BY AYATOLLAHS, MULLAHS AND MILITANT
STUDENTS TO THE DIPLOMATIC PROCESS. SANCTUARY
WAS VIOLATED. IT IS THE AGE-OLD DICHOTOMY OF
ENDS AND MEANS. AT PRESENT THE IRANIANS MIGHT
FEEL GRATIFICATION, BUT THEY HAVE DONE THE WORLD
- INCLUDING THEMSELVES - A GRAVE DISSERVICE.
BEFORE THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN TEHERAN
WAS SEIZED AND BEFORE THE MASS EXECUTIONS OF
THE SHAH'S MEN TOOK PLACE, THERE WERE GROUNDS
FOR SYMPATHY WITH THE REVOLUTION. THE ACTIVIST
MOSLEMS WERE JUSTIFIED IN RESENTING THE
INTERVENTIONIST ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY
SAW THE SHAH, WITH HIS REPRESSIVE AND MESSIANIC
ZEAL, AS THE PRIME SOURCE OF WICKEDNESS. THEY
SAW THE UNITED STATES AS CREATING AND SUSTAINING
HIM. TO THIS DAY, MANY AMERICANS WILL NOT FACE
UP TO WASHINGTON'S MANIPULATION OF IRANIAN
AFFAIRS OVER SEVERAL DECADES. THEY SHOULD DO SO
NOW, WHILE EMOTION IS HIGH, FOR THE MISDEEDS
OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARIES MUST BE SEEN
IN CONTEXT. BUT WHILE THE AMERICANS HELPED
INDIRECTLY TO SET THE SCENE FOR THE REVOLUTION AND
ITS AFTERMATH, THE IRANIANS MUST CARRY THE BLAME
FOR THE HOSTAGE CRISIS.
BOTH THE SEIZURE OF THE EMBASSY AND THE
HOLDING OF THE HOSTAGES FOR 14 MONTHS WERE
INEXCUSABLE. BOTH WERE INFRINGEMENTS OF
CIVILISED AND ACCEPTED STANDARDS OF INTERNATIONAL
CONDUCT. IN THESE TROUBLED TIMES, IN A WORLD
THAT IS GROWING IN COMPLEXITY AND INCREASINGLY
RELIANT FOR ITS SAFETY ON THE DIPLOMATIC PROCESS,
THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARIES HAVE SOWN
UNCERTAINTY AND SET A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. THE
IRANIANS HAVE CLAIMED THERE WAS A CIA NEST
IN THE TEHERAN EMBASSY. GIVEN THE RECORD OF
THE CIA, IT IS A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION THAT
THE CLAIM WAS BASED ON FACT RATHER THAN PARANOIA.
THE WORLD IS WELL AWARE THAT DAGGERS ARE
SOMETIMES CARRIED UNDER DIPLOMATIC CLOAKS AND
NATIONS DEVISE WAYS OF DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM.
BUT IRAN, TORN, ANGRY AND ANARCHIC, BROKE THE
RULES, WRITTEN AND UNWRITTEN.
THE HOSTAGES WERE USED, CALLOUSLY, AS
HUMAN WEAPONS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES AND
IN THE INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLES. THE QUICKEST
AND EASIEST WAY TO STRENGTHEN A POLITICAL
POSITION IN TEHERAN HAS BEEN TO ELICIT A CRY OF
ANGUISH FROM WASHINGTON BY DEMANDING
IMPOSSIBLE TERMS. THIS ATTITUDE CERTAINLY HAS
HELPED THE ACTIVISTS TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE
COUNTRY OVER MORE MODERATE IRANIAN NATIONALISTS.
THIS IS THE BATTLE THE WORLD HAS BEEN WITNESSING
THESE PAST MONTHS, WITH ALL ITS INTERNATIONAL
RAMIFICATIONS. THE FIGHT HAS BEEN BETWEEN THOSE
IRANIANS WHO WANT TO REMAKE THE NATION'S
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LIFE IN THE 20TH CENTURY,
AND THOSE WHO INTERPRET IRAN AND THE WORLD
THROUGH THE EYES OF A 7TH CENTURY
FUNDAMENTALISM IN WHICH MORAL AND CULTURAL
STRICTURES ARE A PREOCCUPATION.
IT HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR IRAN'S SOUL, WITH
ONE SIDE TRYING TO HOLD ON TO THE PRESENT AND
THE OTHER SIDE TRYING TO DRAG THE COUNTRY INTO
THE PAST. NOW THE FUNDAMENTALIST MOSLEMS ARE
ON TOP. THEY HAVE CONSOLIDATED THEIR POSITION,
EVEN IN THE MAJLIS, OR PARLIAMENT. MANY OF THEIR
GOALS HAVE BEEN MET. THE AMERICAN HOSTAGES
HAVE OUTLIVED THEIR USEFULNESS IN THE INTERNAL
STRUGGLE, HENCE THE SWEETNESS AND REASON IN
TEHERAN AND QOM THIS WEEK. THERE WAS NO HOPE
FOR THE RELEASE OF THE DIPLOMATS UNTIL THIS
DECISIVE POLITICAL JUNCTION WAS REACHED.
THAT IS WHY ALL PREVIOUS AMERICAN ATTEMPTS
TO WIN FREEDOM WERE FUTILE, AND WHY NO
PRESSURES OR GESTURES - POLITICAL, MILITARY OR
ECONOMIC - IMPELLED THE ACTIVISTS INTO RELEASING
THE HOSTAGES UNTIL IT SERVED THEIR OWN DOMESTIC
NEEDS. THESE NEEDS HAVE BEEN AN ALL-CONSUMING
PRIORITY, EVEN OVER THE WAR WITH IRAQ. AND NOW,
OF COURSE, WITH A DEGREE OF CLARITY IN TEHERAN'S
ANARCHIC POLITICAL AFFAIRS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE
THE REVOLUTION, THE BILL HAS BEEN PRESENTED.
THE AYATOLLAH KHOMEINY AND HIS CLERICAL
ELITE HAVE BEEN UNDER INCREASING PUBLIC PRESSURE
IN THE PAST MONTHS. ANTI-CLERICAL DEMONSTRATIONS
IN THE CITIES THAT SERVED AS LAUNCHING PADS FOR
THE REVOLUTION HAVE DEEPLY WORRIED THE RELIGIOUS
LEADERS. ESPECIALLY DISTURBING FOR THE AYATOLLAHS
HAS BEEN THE LOSS OF SUPPORT FROM THE MERCHANTS
OF THE BAZAAR, THE REVOLUTION'S PRIME FINANCIAL
MEANS OF SUPPORT. IRAN'S TRADE RELATIONS HAVE
BEEN SEVERELY DAMAGED, EXACERBATING THE ALMOST
AUTOMATIC CHAOS THAT ACCOMPANIES REVOLUTION
ANYWHERE.
THE WAR WITH IRAQ HAS SADDLED THE ARMY,
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY SUPPLIED BY THE AMERICANS
BEFORE THE REVOLUTION, WITH A HUGE BURDEN. AND
WHILE THERE IS NO PROVISION IN THE AGREEMENT
FREEING THE HOSTAGES FOR RENEWED SUPPLIES OF
ARMS AND SPARE PARTS, THE RESTORATION OF MORE
NORMAL RELATIONS WITH WASHINGTON CLEARLY WOULD
BE TO IRAN'S ADVANTAGE.
ANOTHER INCENTIVE TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES WITH
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN THE IMPENDING ADVENT
OF THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION. WHILE IT MAY
HAVE SEEMED UNLIKELY THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN
WOULD RESORT TO MILITARY ACTION, HIS APPROACH
ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE INVOLVED A
PROJECTION OF A NEW, TOUGH AND DETERMINED
FOREIGN POLICY STANCE THAT COULD HAVE TRAPPED
THE IRANIANS IN THEIR OWN INTRANSIGENCE.
FOR MR CARTER THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES
WILL REPRESENT A CLOSING TRIUMPH, HOWEVER
HOLLOW. ALL IN ALL, HE DESERVES MARKS FOR PATIENCE
IN THE FACE OF UNRELENTING PRESSURE. FOR
PRESIDENT-ELECT REAGAN, IT SHOULD BE A SALUTARY
LESSON IN THE COMPLEXITIES AND SENSITIVITIES OF
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. FOR THE UNITED STATES IT
HAS BEEN AN AGONISING LESSON IN THE LIMITS OF A
SUPERPOWER'S CLOUT, AND ONE ALL THE MORE BRUISING
FOR AN AMERICA RECOVERING FROM THE TRAUMA OF
THE VIETNAM WAR.
PERHAPS IT IS TOO EARLY TO EXPECT THE IRANIANS
TO REALISE HOW WRONG THEIR ACTIONS WERE. NATIONS
MUST BE ABLE TO SEND SIGNALS, GIVE WARNINGS,
AND GARNER INFORMATION. IT IS ONE THING TO
WITHDRAW DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION AS PART OF A
CAREFULLY JUDGED POLICY. IT IS ANOTHER THING TO
WRECK THE DIPLOMATIC PROCESS. EVEN WHEN THE
MESSAGE IS UNPALATABLE, THE MESSENGERS SHOULD
BE INVIOLATE. THE MORE SECURE THE CHANNELS OF
COMMUNICATION, THE MORE THE WORLD KNOWS ABOUT
ITSELF AND THE GREATER THE CHANCE OF AVOIDING
DISASTER.
<F87>
WEDNESDAY 21 JANUARY 1981
"CHEATING THE ELECTORATE"
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT A
GOVERNMENT THAT RIGS THE SYSTEM SO THAT IT
CAN WIN ELECTIONS EVEN WHEN A MAJORITY OF
PEOPLE VOTE AGAINST IT. A GOVERNOR GERRY ONCE
DID SO BY THE LABORIOUS METHOD OF DRAWING THE
BOUNDARIES OF EACH ELECTORATE IN SUCH A WAY THAT
HIS OPPONENTS' SUPPORT WAS EFFECTIVELY CONFINED
TO A FEW SAFE SEATS. TODAY THE STATE GOVERNMENTS
OF VICTORIA, QUEENSLAND AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA
RELY ON AN EASIER SYSTEM TO STAY IN POWER: THEY
ENSURE THAT COUNTRY AREAS DOMINATED BY THEIR
SUPPORTERS HAVE MORE MPS THAN THEIR NUMBERS
WARRANT, WHILE CITY AREAS DOMINATED BY THEIR
OPPONENTS HAVE FEWER. THUS, EVEN IF LABOR WON
51 PER CENT OF THE VOTE AFTER PREFERENCES, THE
BIAS IN THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM - GENERALLY KNOWN
AS THE GERRYMANDER - WOULD ENSURE THAT THE
CONSERVATIVES, WITH 49 PER CENT OF THE VOTE,
RETAINED POWER.
THIS PRACTICE OF RIGGING THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM
HAS GONE ON SO LONG THAT IT HAS NUMBED THE
CONSCIENCES OF MANY OTHERWISE HONEST LIBERAL
AND NATIONAL PARTY POLITICIANS. BUT IN PRINCIPLE,
IT IS NO DIFFERENT FROM APPOINTING PARTY
SUPPORTERS TO RUN THE ELECTIONS, OR GIVING SOME
PEOPLE TWO VOTES AND OTHERS ONE. IT IS AN
ATTEMPT TO CHEAT THE ELECTORATE, AND TO ERODE THE
PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO THROW OUT A GOVERNMENT AND
ELECT ANOTHER.
AS OUR REPORT ON MONDAY SHOWED, THE
GERRYMANDER DRAWN UP FOR VICTORIA IN 1974 IS
GROWING WORSE EACH YEAR AS POPULATION CHANGES
MAKE OUR VOTES MORE AND MORE UNEQUAL. IN THE
ASSEMBLY, THE LABOR ELECTORATE OF KEILOR HAS
41,377 VOTERS AND ITS NEIGHBOR WERRIBEE HAS
40,410. YET IN THE WESTERN DISTRICT, LOWAN (NP)
HAS ONLY 25,628 VOTERS, POLWARTH (LIBERAL) HAS
25,670 AND PORTLAND HAS 26,350. IN THE COUNCIL,
THE DISTORTIONS ARE EVEN WORSE: DOUTTA GALLA
(ALP) HAS 143,338 VOTERS WHILE NORTH-WESTERN
(NP) HAS 83,425. THERE IS NO EQUALITY IN THE VALUE
OF OUR VOTES. A BASIC LAW OF DEMOCRACY IS
BEING FLOUTED.
THERE ARE STILL 15 MONTHS BEFORE THE NEXT
STATE ELECTION. THIS GIVES THE GOVERNMENT PLENTY
OF TIME TO CARRY OUT A REDISTRIBUTION OF
BOUNDARIES SO THAT, AT NEXT YEAR'S ELECTION,
EVERYONE'S VOTE WOULD HAVE ROUGHLY EQUAL VALUE.
IF INSTEAD THE GOVERNMENT CHOOSES TO CALL AN
ELECTION ON THE PRESENT DISTORTED BOUNDARIES
RATHER THAN RISK LOSING POWER IN A FAIR CONTEST,
IT WILL BE UNDERMINING THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES
IT CLAIMS TO UPHOLD.
"SANE APPROACH TO ABORTION"
AN ESTIMATED 60,000 ABORTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT
IN AUSTRALIA EVERY YEAR - ABOUT ONE FOR
EVERY FOUR LIVE BIRTHS. MOST PEOPLE, EVEN THOSE
WHO MOST VIGOROUSLY UPHOLD THE RIGHT OF A
WOMAN TO HAVE AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY
TERMINATED, WOULD PROBABLY AGREE THAT THIS FIGURE
IS TOO HIGH. ABORTION IS AN EXTREME MEASURE;
AND THE FACT THAT SO MANY AUSTRALIAN WOMEN
FEEL COMPELLED TO TAKE IT SUGGESTS THAT SOMETHING
IS SERIOUSLY AMISS. BUT WHAT? IS IT, AS SOME ANTI-
ABORTIONISTS CLAIM, THAT WE LIVE TODAY IN A
SELFISH, PLEASURE-SEEKING SOCIETY WHICH HAS LOST
ITS RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE AND HUMAN VALUES? OR
IS THE TRUTH THAT MOST OF THE WOMEN CONCERNED
WOULD REALLY PREFER TO LET THEIR PREGNANCY GO
FULL COURSE, BUT ARE CONSTRAINED FROM DOING SO
BY STRONG SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PRESSURES? OR
DOES THE SOURCE OF MUCH OF THE TROUBLE LIE MUCH
FURTHER BACK - IN INADEQUATE SEX EDUCATION AND
INADEQUATE FAMILY PLANNING FACILITIES?
IN VICTORIA A COMMITTEE OF SIX LIBERAL
BACKBENCHERS - THREE MEN AND THREE WOMEN -
HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THIS CONTENTIOUS QUESTION.
THEY HAVE NOW REPORTED THAT ONLY 5 PER CENT OF
ABORTIONS IN THE STATE ARE UNDERTAKEN ON MEDICAL
GROUNDS. THE REST WERE OFTEN LINKED TO SOCIAL
AND ECONOMIC PRESSURES. THE COMMITTEE HAS
RECOMMENDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEEK
TO REDUCE THE ABORTION RATE, NOT BY DRASTIC LEGAL
MEASURES - THE EFFECT OF WHICH MIGHT BE TO
DRIVE THE ABORTION BUSINESS UNDERGROUND AGAIN
- BUT BY RELIEVING SOME OF THE EXISTING
ECONOMIC PRESSURES. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
WOULD BE ASKED TO INCREASE FAMILY ALLOWANCES,
WHILE THE STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ASKED TO
INCREASE ITS SUBSIDIES FOR HOME HELP FOR PREGNANT
WOMEN. THE COMMITTEE HAS ALSO RECOMMENDED
A PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMME DESIGNED TO
HEIGHTEN AWARENESS ABOUT CONTRACEPTION AND THE
IMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY. IT SAYS THAT
CONTRACEPTIVES SHOULD BE MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE,
AND THAT CONTRACEPTIVE-VENDING MACHINES SHOULD
BE INSTALLED IN HOTELS.
IN THE PAST, SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE
RIGHTS AND WRONGS OF ABORTION HAS BEEN MARRED
BY FACTION-FIGHTING AND NAME-CALLING. SUGGESTIONS
THAT CONTRACEPTIVES AND ADVICE ON CONTRACEPTION
SHOULD BE MADE MORE READILY AVAILABLE HAVE
PROVOKED FURTHER PROTESTS FROM SECTIONS OF THE
COMMUNITY. FACED WITH SUCH HEATED REACTIONS,
THE HAMER GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN REFUGE
BEHIND THE MENHENNITT RULING WHICH EFFECTIVELY
ALLOWS ABORTION, BUT IT HAS LACKED THE COURAGE
TO TAKE THE FURTHER STEP OF CODIFYING IT.
IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE LIBERAL BACK-
BENCHERS' REPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT
SUFFER A SIMILAR FATE. THE COURSE OF ACTION THAT
THEY RECOMMEND IS MODERATE AND PRACTICAL,
STEERING A MIDDLE PATH BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF
THE RIGHT TO LIFERS ON THE ONE HAND AND THOSE
WHO URGE ABORTION ON DEMAND ON THE OTHER.
INSTEAD OF TALKING OF CRIMINAL SANCTIONS FOR
OFFENDERS, THE COMMITTEE HAS RECOGNISED THAT THE
BEST WAY OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ABORTIONS
IS TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR WOMEN TO SEEK
ABORTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
<F88>
THURSDAY 22 JANUARY 1981
"NEW HOPES IN WASHINGTON"
HAVING RECEIVED THE MOST EXPENSIVE
INAUGURATION ACCORDED A NEW PRESIDENT, MR
RONALD REAGAN TODAY CARRIES THE HOPES OF A
NATION WHICH EXPECTS THE WORLD OF HIM, JUST AS
FOUR YEARS AGO IT EXPECTED THE WORLD OF MR
JIMMY CARTER. MR CARTER, WHO CAME TO THE
WHITE HOUSE WITH FULL FAITH IN HIMSELF, HAS NOW
JOINED HIS THREE IMMEDIATE PREDECESSORS IN
BEING HURRIED, IF NOT HARRIED, OUT OF OFFICE. HE
WAS REJECTED CRUSHINGLY BY THE ELECTORATE AND
DENIED DIGNITY AT THE 11TH HOUR BY THE IRANIANS.
WHAT CHANCE HAS THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY OF
LIVING UP TO THE OPTIMISM WHICH PERVADES
WASHINGTON ON INAUGURATION DAYS? SUCH AN
ASSESSMENT MUST BE BASED AS MUCH ON A REVIEW
OF THE CARTER RECORD AS ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE
REAGAN PROPOSALS. DID THE MAN FROM GEORGIA
FAIL? OR DOES THE FAULT LIE IN THE OFFICE, ONE
WHICH INVOLVES LEADING THE WORLD'S GREATEST AND
MOST COMPLEX DEMOCRACY AND ALSO PROVIDING
LEADERSHIP TO THE OTHER DEMOCRACIES IN AN
INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS WORLD?
IN MANY WAYS MR CARTER WAS THE VICTIM OF
HIS OWN VIRTUES. HE WAS ELECTED ON A WAVE OF
DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES
AND POLITICAL MORALITY OF WASHINGTON, AND HE
BELIEVED THAT HE COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEM.
HE WAS ELECTED PARTLY BECAUSE AMERICA WANTED
HIM AND PARTLY BECAUSE THE COMPLEX AMERICAN
POLITICAL SYSTEM THREW HIM UP.
THERE WERE PROMISES, OF COURSE, ABOUT
BALANCED BUDGETS, MORAL FOREIGN POLICIES AND,
ABOVE ALL, HONESTY. THERE WERE BOASTS ABOUT
BEING AN OUTSIDER TO THE CAPITAL'S MURK. THERE
WAS CONTEMPT FOR WASHINGTON'S INSTITUTIONS,
ESPECIALLY FOR AN ILL-DISCIPLINED CONGRESS. THE
CARTER TEAM MADE A VIRTUE OUT OF INNOCENCE AND
IGNORANCE. SOME OF ITS MEMBERS BELIEVED THAT
THEY COULD RUN THE COUNTRY IN SPITE OF
WASHINGTON, AND FOR THAT REASON THE
ADMINISTRATION NEVER REALLY WON CONTROL OF THE
MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT OR CAME TO UNDERSTAND
FULLY ITS COMPLEXITIES, CHECKS AND BALANCES. THEY
NEVER ENTIRELY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY NEEDED
CONGRESS MORE THAN CONGRESS NEEDED THEM.
AT THE END, THE CARTER WHITE HOUSE WAS
ALMOST AS CLOSED TO THE REST OF WASHINGTON AS
AT THE BEGINNING, STILL SHIELDING ITSELF FROM THE
POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND OTHER POWER CENTRES.
THE GEORGIA MAFIA, AS MR CARTER'S COUNSELLORS
WERE CALLED, HAD TOO MUCH INFLUENCE AND TOO
LITTLE EXPERIENCE. MR CARTER FELT COMFORTABLE
WITH THEM(AS HE DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH
THE ESTABLISHED FIGURES OF WASHINGTON) AND SET
GREAT STORE BY THEIR FREQUENTLY BAD ADVICE. MR
CARTER WAS DIMINISHED BY HIS LACK OF GOOD
JUDGMENT ABOUT PERSONALITIES (CONSIDER HIS
BROTHER BILLY AND MR BERT LANCE) AS MUCH AS BY
HIS MISPERCEPTIONS IN GLOBAL MATTERS. THERE WAS
THE CARTER ZEST FOR LONG HOURS, HARD WORK AND
ABOVE ALL THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL. THE BIG
PICTURE BECAME FOGGED. THERE WAS LITTLE
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW EVENTS WERE RELATED.
THERE WAS AN OBSESSION WITH OPINION AND A
READINESS TO FOLLOW THE MOOD RATHER THAN STAND
FAST AND LEAD THE NATION.
FINALLY, THE NATION TURNED ON HIM AND SENT
HIM TO THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION AS THE MOST
UNPOPULAR PRESIDENT SINCE THE DEPRESSION.
POSSIBLY THIS WAS THE GREATEST IRONY OF ALL, THAT
HE SANK LOWER IN PUBLIC OPINION THAN
PRESIDENT NIXON, WHOSE ERA MR CARTER HAD BEEN
ELECTED TO ERASE. IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO ARGUE
THAT HE DESERVED SO MUCH ODIUM. MR CARTER
TRIED HARD, HARDER THAN MANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS.
WHO COULD TAKE EXCEPTION IN THIS IMPERFECT
WORLD TO HIS DRIVE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS? WHICH
AMERICAN COULD CRITICISE MR CARTER'S ZEALOUS
ATTEMPTS TO ALERT THE NATION TO ITS ENERGY CRISIS
AND THE NEED FOR DRAMATIC ACTION? THERE WERE
ACHIEVEMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN FOREIGN POLICY
WITH THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY, THE CAMP DAVID
ACCORDS ON THE MIDDLE EAST, THE EAGERNESS TO
BUILD THE NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA, THE
WILLINGNESS TO HELP BRITAIN SOLVE THE ZIMBABWE
AFFAIR BY STEPPING ASIDE, AND THE SIGNING OF THE
SECOND STRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION TREATY.
THERE WAS BAD LUCK, TOO. BUT THERE WAS A
THREAD OF INCONSISTENCY AND INCOMPETENCE. TOO
MANY PEOPLE SPOKE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AT
THE SAME TIME. TOO FEW OF THE BRZEZINSKIS AND
YOUNGS WERE TOLD TO KEEP QUIET AND LEAVE THE
ELUCIDATION OF FOREIGN POLICY TO THE COMPETENT
AND COURAGEOUS MR VANCE. AT TIMES THE
INCONSISTENCIES SEEMED ALMOST WILFUL, LEAVING THE
WESTERN ALLIANCE IN CONFUSION AND FRUSTRATION
OVER THE NEUTRON BOMB, THE OLYMPIC BOYCOTT
AND AFGHANISTAN, WITH SUDDEN REVERSALS OF
DECISIONS AND INSTANT CONVERSIONS OF MIND. HE
COULD HAIL DICTATORS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE AS
HIS FRIENDS AND SOMETIMES HE WAS ON BOTH
SIDES OF AN ISSUE IN ONE SPEECH. IF AN EPITAPH
WERE TO BE CHOSEN, PERHAPS IT SHOULD READ
THAT GOOD INTENTIONS ALONE DO NOT MAKE AN
EFFECTIVE PRESIDENCY.
THERE ARE LESSONS HERE FOR MR REAGAN AND
ALL HIS COMPATRIOTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE LIMITATIONS
OF THE PRESIDENCY. SOME INCUMBENTS ARE MORE
ACCOMPLISHED THAN OTHERS SIMPLY BY KNOWING
HOW TO WORK WITH THE SYSTEM AND HOW BEST
TO USE THE POWER OF OFFICE. EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS
THAT A PRESIDENT AWARE OF HIS LIMITATIONS, YET
COMMITTED TO ENSURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE
INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH HE MUST DEAL, CAN ASSERT
THAT CRUCIAL LEADERSHIP. MR REAGAN, ONCE THE
INAUGURAL BALLS ARE OVER, NATURALLY WILL BE
SEEKING THAT QUALITY.
WHETHER THE NEW PRESIDENT'S APPARENTLY
UNORTHODOX APPROACH WILL WORK, NO ONE -
NOT EVEN MR REAGAN HIMSELF - CAN KNOW.
THE BIG QUESTION FOR THE UNITED STATES IS WHETHER
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL RULE IN A BROAD
AND EXPANSIVE SPIRIT OR IN A MEAN AND NARROW
ONE. IT IS POSSIBLE, FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS
AT LEAST, FOR MR REAGAN AND THE NEWLY ELECTED
CONSERVATIVES IN CONGRESS TO HAVE THINGS LARGELY
THEIR OWN WAY. IN THE CAMPAIGN THE PRESIDENT
PROJECTED HIMSELF AS A COMFORTABLE LEADER,
SEEKING TO BROADEN HIS UNDERSTANDING AND
WIDEN HIS CONSTITUENCY. BUT TRADITIONALLY, AS MR
REAGAN HIMSELF PUT IT, HIS FEET HAVE BEEN SET
IN CONCRETE ON DIVISIVE ISSUES. THERE ARE GREAT
FEARS IN THE MINORITY COMMUNITIES ABOUT THE
FACT THAT THE VICTORIOUS CONSERVATIVES OWE THEM
NOTHING POLITICALLY. THEY FIND LITTLE REASSURANCE
IN THE PRESIDENT'S PAST PRONOUNCEMENTS ON CIVIL
RIGHTS LAWS, FOR EXAMPLE, OR SOCIAL WELFARE ISSUES.
BY FAR THE BIGGEST AND MOST URGENT PROBLEM
IS WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE ECONOMY. INFLATION IS
GROWING, INTEREST RATES ARE EXORBITANT, GROWTH
IS UNSOUND, UNEMPLOYMENT IS EXPECTED TO RISE.
IF THE ECONOMISTS CAN AGREE ON ANYTHING IT
IS THAT THE UNITED STATES IS SLIPPING INTO ANOTHER
SLUMP. MR REAGAN'S ADVISERS ARE ALREADY
STRUGGLING IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO JUGGLE ALL OF
THIS AND AT THE SAME TIME SEE TO THE CAMPAIGN
PROMISES OF LOWER INCOME TAX, A BALANCED BUDGET
AND INCREASED DEFENCE SPENDING. ONE LOOK AT
MR REAGAN'S INHERITED BUDGET DEFICIT - ABOUT
$60,000 MILLION - SUGGESTS THAT THOSE PROMISES
WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP.
ALREADY THERE ARE FEARS THAT THE NEW
ADMINISTRATION IS LOCKING ITSELF INTO POLICIES
THAT WILL OFFER MORE OF THE SAME. THERE ARE
CONSUMING FEARS THAT MR REAGAN AND HIS TEAM
OF MONETARIST ECONOMIC ADVISERS WILL THROW
THEMSELVES AND THE COUNTRY INTO A THATCHER-
STYLE EXPERIMENT. THERE WILL BE OTHER EARLY
CHALLENGES IN THE SINKING AMERICAN MOTOR
INDUSTRY AND IN THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD'S SINKING
OIL STOCKS AS THE PERSIAN GULF WAR DRAGS ON.
THERE WILL BE EARLY FOREIGN POLICY TESTS IN
CENTRAL AMERICA AND NORTH AFRICA, AND ABOVE
ALL THERE WILL BE THE DESIRE TO SHOW THE SOVIET
UNION AND ITS SURROGATES THAT THEY CANNOT GET
AWAY WITH MARCHING INTO THE COUNTRY NEXT DOOR.
FOR THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEXT FOUR YEARS,
PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS CHOSEN A MOSTLY
UNEXCITING TEAM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE
HAWKISH AND AMBITIOUS MR HAIG, WHOSE RECORD
DURING THE VIETNAM WAR AND WATERGATE RAISES
WORRYING QUESTIONS. BUT AT LEAST MOST OF THE
CABINET ARE PEOPLE OF SOME STANDING IN THEIR
FIELDS. THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE THANKFUL
THAT A GROUP OF WILD AND INEXPERIENCED
CALIFORNIANS HAS NOT TAKEN OVER FROM THE CARTER
GEORGIANS. IF MR REAGAN FINDS THAT HE CANNOT
LIVE UP TO THE VISIONS OF HIS CAMPAIGN, IT WILL
BE BECAUSE THE PROMISES WERE GROUNDED IN
MYTHOLOGY RATHER THAN REALITY. HE HAS OFFERED
SIMPLE SOLUTIONS TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS, AND NOW
HE IS STUCK WITH THE NATION'S HOPES FOR THE
RESTORATION OF A HAPPY PAST THAT NEVER WAS.
<F89>
FRIDAY 23 JANUARY 1981
"WHAT WORK, MR VINER?"
THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S
FORESHADOWED REVIEW OF SCHOOLING, TRAINING,
EMPLOYMENT AND YOUTH DOLE PAYMENTS, ACCORDING
TO THE MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT AND YOUTH
AFFAIRS, IS THAT "THE BEST INTERESTS OF YOUNG
PEOPLE ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE SERVED BY EDUCATING
THEM TO A STAGE AT WHICH THEY ARE QUALIFIED AND
MOTIVATED TO FIND REWARDING WORK". WHAT WORK,
MR VINER? IN DECEMBER 430,000 AUSTRALIANS WERE
LOOKING FOR WORK, ONE-THIRD OF THEM TEENAGERS,
BUT ONLY ABOUT 30,000 JOBS WERE LOOKING FOR
WORKERS. MOST YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE DOLE
ARE UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT NEARLY
ENOUGH JOBS FOR THEM, NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE
STUPID OR LAZY OR BECAUSE THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
HAS FAILED THEM. THIS WAS THE CENTRAL POINT
OF OUR EDITORIAL OPINION ON MONDAY, WHICH MR
VINER, IN HIS OPEN SPACE ARTICLE YESTERDAY,
SAID HAD MISINTERPRETED THE GOVERNMENT'S
DECISION.
IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT MANY YOUNGSTERS
LEAVE SCHOOL ILL-PREPARED, IN KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS
AND ATTITUDES, TO EARN THEIR LIVING. IT IS ALSO
TRUE THAT MANY SCHOOLS ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO
TAKE ACADEMIC COURSES LEADING TO TERTIARY
STUDIES FOR WHICH MOST HAVE NO APTITUDE OR
DESIRE. WE AGREE WITH MR VINER THAT SCHOOLS
COULD BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF SOME OF THEIR
STUDENTS, THAT THERE SHOULD BE WIDER
OPPORTUNITIES FOR TECHNICAL AND MIDDLE LEVEL
TRAINING, AND THAT VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE SHOULD
BE IMPROVED. IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTENDS
TO URGE AND ASSIST THE STATES TO PURSUE THESE
OBJECTIVES, GOOD! BUT THIS IS NOT THE CONTEXT IN
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION WAS PRESENTED.
NOR DO THE FEDERAL-SPONSORED TRAINING SCHEMES
ALREADY UNDER WAY INSPIRE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN
THE LATEST PROPOSALS.
THE PRIME MINISTER, MR FRASER, HAS
SUGGESTED THAT DOLE PAYMENTS ARE ENCOURAGING
YOUNG PEOPLE TO LEAVE SCHOOL EARLY, AND HAS
QUESTIONED WHETHER IN FUTURE THEY SHOULD BE
ENTITLED TO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IF THEY
REFUSED TO TAKE UP PLACES IN EXPANDED TRAINING
AND EDUCATION SCHEMES. HE SAID AN INCREASED
NUMBER OF BOYS HAD LEFT SCHOOL SINCE 1974
WHEN HIGHER ALLOWANCES WERE INTRODUCED. THE
EVIDENCE FOR MR FRASER'S SUPPOSITION IS BOTH
FLIMSY AND SPECULATIVE. THE PROPORTION OF 16-
YEAR-OLDS AT SCHOOL ROSE FROM 53.3 PER CENT TO
58.7 PER CENT IN THE FIVE YEARS TO 1979, AND
OF 17-YEAR-OLDS FROM 29.6 PER CENT TO 31.5 PER
CENT. TAKING MALES ONLY, THE FIGURES FOR 17-
YEAR-OLDS SHOW A MARGINAL DECLINE FROM 31.4
TO 30.1 PER CENT FROM 1974 TO 1979.
ANOTHER SET OF STATISTICS, MEASURING
"RETENTION RATES" (YEAR 12 STUDENTS AS A
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WHO BEGAN SECONDARY
SCHOOL SIX YEARS EARLIER), SHOW A SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT TREND. THE RETENTION RATE FOR BOYS,
31.1 PER CENT IN 1969, ROSE TO A PEAK OF 35.7
PER CENT IN 1972 AND DECLINED TO 32.4 PER
CENT IN 1979. WHETHER THE DECLINE WAS DUE TO
DOLE PAYMENTS, OR TO FAMILIES BEING LESS ABLE
TO AFFORD TO KEEP CHILDREN AT SCHOOL, OR TO
SOME OTHER FACTOR, IS A MATTER FOR SPECULATION.
IN ANY CASE, THE THREE BOYS IN 100 WHO ARE
LEAVING SCHOOL EARLIER ARE MORE THAN OFFSET BY
THE NUMBER OF GIRLS STAYING LONGER. THE RETENTION
RATE FOR GIRLS ROSE SHARPLY FROM 23.3 PER CENT
IN 1969 TO 37.3 PER CENT IN 1978, WITH A MARGINAL
FALL TO 37.2 PER CENT IN 1979.
IN THEIR PUBLIC STATEMENTS, MR FRASER AND
MR VINER ARE CONFUSING TWO ISSUES WHICH HAVE,
AT MOST, ONLY A TENUOUS LINK. ONE IS THE FAILURE
OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM TO MEET THE NEEDS OF
MANY OF THEIR STUDENTS. THE OTHER IS THE FAILURE
OF THE ECONOMY TO OFFER SUFFICIENT JOBS TO EMPLOY
SCHOOL LEAVERS. IN A RECENT REPORT, THE SCHOOLS
COMMISSION, CONCLUDING THAT MOST SCHOOLS "LAG
IN THEIR ADJUSTMENT TO THE NEEDS OF THE FULL
RANGE OF STUDENTS" ADDED: "THE COMMISSION IS
NOT IN ANY WAY SUBSCRIBING TO CLAIMS THAT HIGH
YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE
FAILURE OF SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLING. SUCH CLAIMS
ARE MANIFESTLY WITHOUT FOUNDATION SINCE THERE
ARE NOT ENOUGH JOBS WHICH UNEMPLOYED YOUNG
PEOPLE CAN GET". BY ALL MEANS, LET THE
GOVERNMENT IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND RELEVANCE
OF EDUCATION. BUT THIS DOES NOT JUSTIFY ANY
REDUCTION IN THE MISERLY UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT
 - FROZEN FOR FIVE YEARS AT $36 A WEEK -
AVAILABLE TO YOUNG PEOPLE UNDER 18. UNLESS THE
GOVERNMENT CAN STIMULATE THE CREATION OF MORE
JOBS, THE MAIN EFFECTS OF ITS EFFORTS TO KEEP
YOUNGSTERS AT SCHOOL LONGER WILL BE TO DISGUISE
THE UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS AND TO PRODUCE A
BETTER-EDUCATED, BETTER-QUALIFIED AND PRESUMABLY
EVEN MORE FRUSTRATED CLASS OF JOBLESS YOUNG
PEOPLE.
"GOTHIC FACE, MODERN BEHIND"
OWNERSHIP OF A CLASSIFIED HISTORIC BUILDING
CAN BE A MIXED BLESSING. WHILE THE BUILDING
CONFERS PRESTIGE ON ITS OWNERS, ITS CLASSIFICATION
MEANS THAT THEY CAN'T SUBSTANTIALLY ALTER OR
REDEVELOP IT. THE NATIONAL MUTUAL COMPANY
FOUND THIS WITH THE RIALTO SITE IN COLLINS STREET.
THE COMPANY MADE A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS FOR
THE SITE'S DEVELOPMENT: AS A CASINO SITE, A HOTEL
COMPLEX, A CONVENTION CENTRE, AND AS THE
LOCATION FOR THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE. ALL OF THEM
WERE TURNED DOWN BY THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH
PREFERRED TO SITE A CONVENTION CENTRE IN THE
EXHIBITION GARDENS (AN APPALLING PROSPECT) AND
THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE AT NORTH WHARF.
IN DESPERATION, NATIONAL MUTUAL PUT THE $10
MILLION SITE UP FOR SALE. AN OPTION TO PURCHASE
WAS TAKEN UP BY A DEVELOPMENT FIRM, GROLLO
BUILDING AND ENGINEERING, WHICH HAS BEEN
EXPLORING VARIOUS SITE USAGE PLANS. ONE PLAN
APPARENTLY ENVISAGES THE DEMOLITION OF THE BACK
OF THE 19TH-CENTURY RIALTO BUILDINGS AND THEIR
BALCONIES TO MAKE WAY FOR A 50-STOREY HOTEL AND
OFFICE BLOCK. ONLY THE FACADE WOULD BE PRESERVED.
AT THE MOMENT THE BLOCK OF BUILDINGS IS
DESIGNATED BY THE HISTORIC BUILDINGS PRESERVATION
COUNCIL, AND CANNOT BE DEMOLISHED OR EVEN
ALTERED WITHOUT APPROVAL. THE GROLLO GROUP IS
HOPING THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE OBLIGING AND
RELAX ITS CONTROLS.
FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO DO SO WOULD BE A
DENIAL OF EVERYTHING IT HAS SAID ABOUT MAINTAINING
VICTORIA'S HERITAGE. THE SO-CALLED PARIS END OF
COLLINS STREET HAS ALREADY BEEN DESTROYED. ARE
THE FEW HISTORIC BUILDINGS IN THE WESTERN END OF
COLLINS STREET TO GO THE SAME SORRY WAY? GROLLO,
LIKE NATIONAL MUTUAL, HAS A PROBLEM. THE
SUGGESTED SOLUTION, HOWEVER - A GOTHIC FRONT
AND A CONTEMPORARY BEHIND - WOULD BE THE
VERY WORST KIND OF COMPROMISE. IT PAYS LIP
SERVICE TO THE IDEA OF CONSERVATION, AND THAT IS
ALL. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REJECT THE SCHEME, IF
AND WHEN GROLLO PUT IT FORWARD, AND TELL THEM
THAT THE ONLY DESIGN WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE IS ONE
THAT SUBSTANTIALLY RETAINS THE RIALTO BUILDINGS
AND IS ARCHITECTURALLY IN KEEPING WITH THEM.
ONE OF THE EARLIER PLANS PUT FORWARD FOR THE
SITE - BUT REJECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT -
INCORPORATED MULTI-LEVEL GALLERIAS (OR WALKWAYS),
ENCLOSED COURTYARDS (WHICH MAKE SENSE, GIVEN
MELBOURNE'S WINDY AND ERRATIC CLIMATE), PLACES
OF ENTERTAINMENT AS WELL AS SHOPS, AND PLEASANT
VIEWS INTO THE OLDER BUILDINGS. SOMETHING LIKE
THIS WOULD BE FAR PREFERABLE TO A SCHEME THAT
KEEPS THE RIALTO FACADE AND NOTHING MORE.

SATURDAY 24 JANUARY 1981
"OPERA FUTURE STILL CLOUDED"
AFTER A FORTNIGHT OF DISCUSSIONS, THE
VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE AUSTRALIA
COUNCIL HAVE AGREED ON A PLAN WHICH WILL ALLOW
THE VICTORIA STATE OPERA TO CARRY OUT ITS
PLANNED PROGRAMME FOR 1981. THE TROUBLE AROSE
WHEN THE VSO - EXPECTING A GRANT OF $385,000
FROM THE AUSTRALIA COUNCIL FOR THE PRESENT
YEAR - SUDDENLY FOUND, AFTER ANNOUNCING ITS
SEASON AND SELLING THOUSANDS OF TICKETS, THAT
ALL IT COULD EXPECT FROM THE FEDERAL BODY WAS
WHAT IT RECEIVED LAST YEAR: $45,000. THE VSO
WAS FACED WITH THE PROSPECT OF EITHER CURTAILING
ITS PROGRAMME OR ABANDONING IT COMPLETELY.
IN EITHER CASE ITS REPUTATION WITH ITS SINGERS
AND WITH THE OPERA-GOING PUBLIC WOULD HAVE
BEEN DAMAGED, PERHAPS IRREPARABLY. RECOGNISING
THIS, THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS AGREED TO BACK
THE COMPANY TO THE TUNE OF AN EXTRA $316,000,
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CUTTING ITS GRANT TO THE
AUSTRALIAN OPERA BY $70,000. THE AUSTRALIA
COUNCIL, FOR ITS PART, HAS AGREED TO CHIP IN A
FURTHER $135,000 TO THE VSO.
IT IS A GOOD RESULT FOR THE VSO, IF NOT
THE AUSTRALIAN OPERA. IT MEANS THAT VICTORIANS
CAN LOOK FORWARD TO A BUSY YEAR OF OPERA-GOING.
BETWEEN THEM THE TWO COMPANIES WILL MOUNT
15 PRODUCTIONS. IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE
MELBOURNE HAD SO MUCH OPERA GOING ON. BUT
WHILE THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN
OVERCOME, THE LONGER-TERM POSITION OF OPERA IN
MELBOURNE IS MUCH LESS CLEAR. IN TWO YEARS TIME
THE 2000-SEAT OPERA AND BALLET THEATRE AT THE ARTS
CENTRE WILL OPEN ITS DOORS. VERY SOON BOTH
OPERA COMPANIES WILL NEED TO START PLANNING FOR
THE INAUGURAL SEASON. YET AT THE MOMENT NEITHER
COMPANY HAS ANY IDEA WHAT ITS FUNDING THEN
WILL BE. NOR HAS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
STATE AND NATIONAL COMPANY BEEN RESOLVED.
THE MCKINNON REPORT, COMMISSIONED BY THE
AUSTRALIA COUNCIL AND DELIVERED LAST MAY,
RECOMMENDED THAT WHILE THE AO SHOULD REMAIN
THE NATIONAL COMPANY, IT SHOULD SPEND MORE
OF ITS TIME IN SYDNEY AND LESS TIME TOURING
INTERSTATE. IT ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT OVER THE
NEXT FIVE YEARS THE VSO SHOULD BE BUILT UP
PROGRESSIVELY TO THE POINT WHERE IT BECAME AN
ALL-THE-YEAR-ROUND ENSEMBLE. THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT HAS AVOIDED MAKING A DECISION ONE
WAY OR ANOTHER ON THE REPORT. IT CANNOT DO SO
MUCH LONGER. IT MAKES SENSE TO BUILD UP THE
VSO, BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE DONE TO THE
EXCLUSION FROM VICTORIA OF THE AO. THE TWO
COMPANIES ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. THEY HAVE
DIFFERENT AIMS, PRIORITIES AND REPERTOIRES, AND
THEY EMPLOY DIFFERENT SINGERS. MELBOURNE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO ENJOY THE BEST THAT BOTH COMPANIES
CAN PROVIDE, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE AO IS KEEN
TO MAINTAIN ITS MELBOURNE PRESENCE. DIVERSITY,
NOT MONOPOLY, SHOULD BE THE GOVERNMENT'S
OPERATIC POLICY.
"A SATURDAY REFLECTION"
THE AGE OF THE SILICON CHIP HAS PRODUCED A
NEW GENERATION OF PROSPECTORS ARMED WITH
METAL DETECTORS. ALTHOUGH THEIR EQUIPMENT IS
NEW, THEY BELONG TO A LONG LINE OF EAGER GOLD
SEEKERS STRETCHING BACK TO ANTIQUITY, WHEN MEN
DUG THE PRECIOUS METAL WITH ANTLERS FROM THE
HILLS OF NUBIA.
AS TODAY'S HOPEFUL FOSSICKER WAVES HIS
ELECTRONIC DIVINING ROD OVER THE SOIL OF FORMER
GOLDFIELDS, HIS HEART LEAPS WHENEVER THE TELL-TALE
BEEPER INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF BURIED METAL.
EVEN WHEN HE DIGS UP NOTHING MORE ROMANTIC
THAN THE REMAINS OF A BILLY CAN, A PIECE OF
RUSTED HOOP IRON, AN OLD BRASS BUTTON OR A
QUEEN VICTORIA PENNY, HE IS NOT DISCOURAGED.
ALWAYS THERE IS THE HOPE THAT THE GRAVEL IN
HIS SHOVEL WILL YIELD A NUGGET THAT OUT-VALUES
EVERYTHING ELSE HE UNEARTHS IN HIS QUEST.
ON MAKING A STRIKE, THE PROSPECTOR MIGHT
REFLECT ON HIS SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE. THE NUGGET
HE BRINGS TO LIGHT HAS LAIN IN THE EARTH FROM
THE BEGINNING OF TIME. GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE
MIGHT HAVE WALKED OVER IT, CATTLE GRAZED ABOVE
IT, MINERS MISSED IT. IT MIGHT HAVE REMAINED
THERE FOR CENTURIES TO COME HAD NOT HIS
PARTICULAR DETECTOR LOCATED IT.
IN THIS PRAGMATIC AGE IT MAY SEEM ODD
THAT THE PROSPECTOR SHOULD SEARCH SO KEENLY FOR
A METAL THAT HAS RELATIVELY FEW PRACTICAL USES.
SOME OTHER METALS SUCH AS IRON, COPPER, TIN,
ALUMINIUM AND SILVER ARE SO USEFUL THAT TO MINE
THEM IS ALMOST A NECESSITY. BUT PURE GOLD IS
UNSUITABLE FOR LITTLE ELSE THAN STORING IN VAULTS,
DISPLAYING IN MUSEUMS OR WEARING ON CHAINS.
ONLY WHEN THE "NOBLE" ELEMENT IS ALLOYED WITH
"BASE" METALS IS IT HARD ENOUGH FOR A PLATE, A
MEDAL, A COIN OR A TOOTH.BUT THAT IS UNIMPORTANT
TO THE PROSPECTOR. HE IS CONCERNED WITH GOLD'S
INTRINSIC, RATHER THAN ITS FUNCTIONAL, VALUE.
HAVING UNEARTHED THE PRECIOUS PRIZE HE
MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH IT. HE MAY WANT
TO KEEP IT AS A TREASURE FOR ITS OWN SAKE, TO
BE BROUGHT OUT FROM UNDER LOCK AND KEY FROM
TIME TO TIME AND DISPLAYED, HANDLED AND
ADMIRED.
MORE PROBABLY HIS COMMERCIAL INSTINCT WILL
OVER-RULE HIS SENTIMENTALITY, FOR MOST
PROSPECTORS' DISCOVERIES, EVEN OF THE MOST
GLAMOROUS NUGGETS, ARE SOON FOLLOWED BY AN
APPRAISAL OF THEIR WORTH IN DOLLARS. TO REALISE
ITS VALUE HE MUST SELL HIS NUGGET AND CONVERT
IT INTO HARD CASH. THE ANTICIPATION OF WEALTH
HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PRIME MOTIVATING FACTOR IN
THE SEARCH FOR GOLD.
YET EVEN THE MOST PRECIOUS METAL DOES NOT
REPRESENT LIFE'S ULTIMATE VALUE. MAN HAS ALWAYS
SEARCHED FOR LESS TANGIBLE, BUT DESIRABLE TREASURE
- LIKE A CONTENTED MIND, INNER PEACE, CONFIDENT
HOPE. NOT ONLY HAS MONEY NOT BEEN ABLE TO
BUY THEM; PREOCCUPATION WITH MONEY HAS OFTEN
DESTROYED THEM.
THOSE ELEMENTS OF A FULL LIFE TURN OUT TO
BE BY-PRODUCTS OF A STILL GREATER REALITY, WHICH
CHRIST LIKENED TO "TREASURE HIDDEN IN A FIELD".
IT WAS OF SUCH SURPASSING WORTH, HE SAID, THAT
ANYONE WOULD GLADLY SELL ALL HE HAD TO BUY THAT
FIELD.
<F91>
MONDAY 26 JANUARY 1981
"THE LOOP THAT CAME TOO LATE"
THE UNDERGROUND RAILWAY LOOP IS A FITTING
MONUMENT FOR MELBOURNE, A REMINDER OF
THE INEPTITUDE, IMPROVIDENCE AND DISTORTED
PRIORITIES THAT HAVE CHARACTERISED VICTORIAN
GOVERNMENTS SO LONG AS ANYONE CAN REMEMBER.
IT HAS BEEN BUILT TOO LATE AND, LIKE SO MANY
OTHER PUBLIC PROJECTS, AT TOO HIGH A COST.
PERHAPS THE WONDER IS THAT IT WAS EVER ATTEMPTED
AT ALL. SOME OTHER WORKS LISTED IN MELBOURNE'S
1929 TOWN PLAN AS "URGENT" HAVE STILL NOT BEEN
BEGUN, AND THE CITY HAS SUFFERED AS A RESULT.
TYPICALLY, THE UNDERGROUND RAILWAY HAS BEEN
TALKED ABOUT FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS. THIS IS
NOT A RECORD: A LOWER YARRA CROSSING, NOW
REPRESENTED BY THE WEST GATE BRIDGE, WAS FIRST
PROPOSED IN THE 1880S. TYPICALLY, TOO, THE LOOP
HAS BEEN NINE YEARS AND SEVEN MONTHS IN THE
BUILDING, TWO YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE, AND WILL
NOT BE COMPLETED FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS. AND TRUE
TO TRADITION, UNION BANS DELAYED THE OFFICIAL
OPENING BY TWO MONTHS.
THE "LOOP" IS ACTUALLY NOT ONE BUT FOUR
LOOPS. ONLY TWO OF THESE LOOPS, AND ONE OF THREE
CITY STATIONS, IS IN OPERATION. THE PROJECT IS
SOMETHING OF AN ENGINEERING ACHIEVEMENT, AND
THOSE WHO DESIGNED AND BUILT IT DESERVE
THE PUBLIC'S CONGRATULATIONS. BUT COMPARED
WITH SOME OF THE COMPLETE METROPOLITAN
RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEMS CONSTRUCTED IN RECENT
YEARS IN OVERSEAS CITIES, IT IS HARDLY
ONE OF THE TRANSPORT WONDERS OF THE
WORLD. IT WILL, IN FACT, SERVE ONLY TWO VERY LIMITED
PURPOSES. VICRAIL PRESSED STRONGLY FOR THE
PROJECT TO HELP IT OVERCOME ITS PEAK PERIOD
TURNAROUND PROBLEM AT FLINDERS STREET STATION,
AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL SOLVE THESE
DIFFICULTIES. FOR CITY COMMUTERS, IT OFFERS FIVE
INSTEAD OF TWO PERIPHERAL CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT
STATIONS (WHEN ALL ARE OPEN) AND WILL SAVE SOME
OF THE COST AND INCONVENIENCE OF TRAM TRANSFERS.
BUT CITY RAIL COMMUTERS REPRESENT ONLY A
DIMINISHING FRACTION OF ALL METROPOLITAN
COMMUTERS. A THIRD ADVANTAGE CLAIMED FOR THE
LOOP IS THAT IT WILL "OPEN UP" THE NORTH OF THE
CITY. WHETHER IT WILL IN FACT DO SO REMAINS TO
BE PROVEN.
THE UNDERGROUND LOOP HAS COME INTO
OPERATION AT LEAST 30 YEARS AFTER ITS OPTIMUM
VALUE. IT WAS IN THE IMMEDIATE POST-WAR YEARS
THAT SUBURBAN TRAIN TRAVEL WAS AT ITS PEAK, WHEN
MOST OF MELBOURNE'S OFFICES, FACTORIES AND
SHOPPING CENTRES WERE WITHIN EASY REACH OF THE
RADIAL RAIL NETWORK, AND WHEN TRAINS AND TRAMS
WERE UNCOMFORTABLY CROWDED AT PEAK PERIODS.
SINCE THEN, MELBOURNE HAS SPRAWLED BEYOND
THE CONVENIENT SPAN OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT, INDUSTRY
AND COMMERCE HAVE DECENTRALISED, WITH THE CITY
ACCOUNTING FOR A DECLINING PROPORTION OF THE
METROPOLITAN WORKFORCE, AND THE PRIVATE
MOTOR CAR HAS BECOME THE PREDOMINANT MODE OF
PERSONAL TRANSPORT. NOT THE LEAST IRONY IS THAT
THE LOOP HAS OPENED JUST AS THE GOVERNMENT IS
CONSIDERING THE CLOSURE OF SEVERAL SUBURBAN
RAILWAY LINES BECAUSE OF DWINDLING PATRONAGE
AND RISING DEFICITS.
THE GOVERNMENT'S HOPE IS THAT THE RISING
COST OF PETROL WILL INDUCE MORE PEOPLE TO TRAVEL
BY TRAIN AND THAT THE UNDERGROUND LOOP AND
OTHER IMPROVEMENTS WILL MAKE RAIL TRAVEL TO THE
CITY MORE ATTRACTIVE. WE SHARE THAT HOPE, BUT
WITHOUT MUCH CONFIDENCE. DESPITE A TREND BACK
TOWARDS INNER SUBURBAN LIVING, MELBOURNE SEEMS
STILL TOO SPREAD OUT, AND TOO DIFFUSED, FOR THE CITY
RAIL LOOP TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE TO RAIL
PATRONAGE AND FINANCES. IT IS MORE LIKELY TO
DIMINISH CITY TRAM PATRONAGE. EVEN IF DOES
ATTRACT PEOPLE BACK TO TRAINS, IT WILL DO SO AT
ENORMOUS COST TO THE PUBLIC. THE LOOP PROJECT,
ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED TO COST $80 MILLION, WILL
EXCEED $500 MILLION BY THE TIME IT IS FINISHED,
OR ABOUT $1600 MILLION WITH INTEREST PAYMENTS.
SELDOM IF EVER IN THIS STATE HAS SO MUCH BEEN
SPENT FOR SO LITTLE.
"AS GROWTH COMES TO PORTLAND"
THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE.
WHEN PORTLAND WAS IN FEAR OF STAGNATION,
ITS LEADERS WERE CONSTANTLY LOBBYING DECISION-
MAKERS TO TRY TO SEDUCE INDUSTRY TO THE TOWN.
NEW FACTORIES WOULD PROVIDE JOBS FOR TEENAGERS
WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO LEAVE PORTLAND.
THEY WOULD BRING PROSPERITY TO THE TOWN,
STIMULATE EMPLOYMENT IN OTHER BUSINESSES AND
LEAD TO A BETTER AND WIDER RANGE OF SERVICES.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PORT HAD ALREADY GIVEN
PORTLAND A TASTE OF GROWTH; IT WANTED MORE.
NOW THAT GROWTH IS COMING TO PORTLAND, THE
TOWN SEEMS TO BE HAVING DOUBTS. AT THE OUT-
SKIRTS OF THE TOWN, THE BIGGEST FACTORY IN VICTORIA
IS NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION; AND AS ITS POPULATION
LOOKS LIKE GROWING BY TWO-THIRDS IN TWO YEARS,
THE TOWNSPEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THE DRAWBACKS
OF RAPID GROWTH. THE PRICE OF LAND AND HOUSING
HAS SOARED AS ALCOA ITSELF AND LOCAL SPECULATORS
HAVE BOUGHT UP BIG. RENTS HAVE INCREASED
SHARPLY, NEW WORKERS HAVE MOVED IN, COMMUNITY
SERVICES ARE FACING STRAINS AND MASSAGE PARLORS
AND A SEX SHOP ARE COMING TO A GENERALLY SEDATE
WESTERN DISTRICT TOWN.
THE SCENE IS SET FOR A FASCINATING CHANGE
IN PORTLAND'S LIFESTYLE, ONE WORTHY OF AN
ACADEMIC STUDY OR A CRAWFORD SOAP OPERA. THE
DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY WELFARE SERVICES HAD
COMMISSIONED A CSIRO EXPERT TO CARRY OUT THE
FORMER - BUT ITS DECISION HAS BEEN OVERRULED
BY A COUNCIL OF STATE MINISTERS. IN KEEPING WITH
THE HAMER GOVERNMENT'S NEW "DEVELOPMENT
FIRST" OBSESSION, THE MINISTER FOR ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT, MR IAN SMITH, HAS PERSUADED HIS
COLLEAGUES TO SPEND THE MONEY NOT ON A STUDY
BUT ON ACTION, INCLUDING A NEW SOCIAL RESOURCES
CENTRE AND A PRIMARY SCHOOL. IT SEEMS A PITY
THAT WE CAN'T HAVE BOTH. PORTLAND'S EXPERIENCE
COULD BE AN EXCITING AND VALUABLE ONE FOR OTHERS
TO LEARN FROM.
<F92>
WEDNESDAY 28 JANUARY 1981
"TAX REFORM REQUIRES DEBATE"
THE POINT HAS BEEN MADE BEFORE, AND THE
PRIME MINISTER, MR FRASER, HAS MADE IT
AGAIN, THAT AUSTRALIANS ARE NOT, BY INTERNATIONAL
STANDARDS, HIGHLY TAXED. AMONG THE WESTERN
WORLD'S TOP 20 INDUSTRIAL NATIONS, AUSTRALIA RANKS
16TH IN THE LEVEL OF TOTAL TAXATION (FEDERAL, STATE
AND LOCAL) AS A PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL OUTPUT OF
GOODS AND SERVICES. HOWEVER, AS MR FRASER
CONCEDES, AUSTRALIA LEVIES A HIGHER PROPORTION
OF ITS TOTAL TAXATION IN INCOME TAX THAN ALL BUT
TWO OR THREE OTHER OECD COUNTRIES, AND THIS
PROPORTION HAS STEADILY GROWN IN RECENT YEARS
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF INFLATION.
THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT, AS A MATTER OF
POLICY, HAS LONG FAVORED A RESTRUCTURING OF THE
TAX SYSTEM SO AS TO IMPOSE LESS TAX ON WHAT
PEOPLE EARN AND MORE ON WHAT THEY SPEND. IT HAS
BEEN INHIBITED FROM PUTTING ITS PHILOSOPHICAL
PREFERENCES INTO PRACTICE BY PROTESTS FROM THOSE
WHO FEAR THAT THEY (AND SOME LESS ABLE TO SPEAK
FOR THEMSELVES) WOULD BE DISADVANTAGED BY
SUCH A CHANGE. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN OBJECTIONS
FROM THOSE WHO FEAR THAT ANY NEW TAX IS BOUND
TO GROW AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY
OFFSET, AS PROMISED, BY REDUCTIONS IN INCOME
TAX. BUT NOW, WITH AN ELECTION BEHIND IT AND WITH
THE SUPPORT OF SOME INFLUENTIAL BUSINESS
INTERESTS, THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING AGAIN AT
SOME NEW OR EXTENDED FORM OF CONSUMPTION TAX.
INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS
ALREADY DECIDED IN PRINCIPLE TO INCREASE INDIRECT
TAX AND THAT THE KEY QUESTIONS TO BE SETTLED ARE
HOW, WHEN AND HOW MUCH. NO DOUBT THE
GOVERNMENT PREFERS A TAX THAT WILL RAISE THE MOST
REVENUE WITH THE LEAST COST TO ITSELF AND THE LEAST
FUSS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND, UNDERSTANDABLY, NO
DECISION IS LIKELY TO BE ANNOUNCED UNTIL AFTER THE
BY-ELECTIONS ON 21 FEBRUARY. BUT IF THE
GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO SWITCH THE
EMPHASIS FROM DIRECT TO INDIRECT TAX, IT SHOULD
INDICATE THE EXTENT AND EXPLAIN THE RATIONALE.
THE MAIN JUSTIFICATION FOR A HIGH RELIANCE ON
INCOME TAX IS THAT IT IS RELATED TO ABILITY TO PAY.
A TAX ON CONSUMPTION IS REGRESSIVE. ALTHOUGH THE
RICH SPEND MORE THAN THE POOR, INDIRECT TAX TAKES
A GREATER PROPORTION OF A POOR MAN'S INCOME
THAN A RICH MAN'S. BUT AUSTRALIA'S INCOME TAX
SYSTEM IS NO LONGER EQUITABLE. IT OFFERS
OPPORTUNITIES, ESPECIALLY TO THE SELF-EMPLOYED AND
THOSE ABLE TO CONVERT INCOME INTO ASSETS, TO
AVOID TAX, AND THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE BEING
EXPLOITED AT A COST TO REVENUE - AND OTHER
TAXPAYERS - OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
A YEAR. THERE HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN
THE BURDEN OF INCOME TAX ON THOSE TIED TO THE
PAY-AS-YOU-EARN SCHEME AS COMPARED TO THOSE
WHOSE TAX IS NOT DEDUCTED BY EMPLOYERS. THIS
DISCREPANCY IS A DISINCENTIVE TO HIGHLY PAID
EMPLOYEES TO SEEK PROMOTION OR TAKE ON
ADDITIONAL DUTIES, IT GIVES AN IMPETUS TO HIGHER
WAGE DEMANDS, AND IT EXACERBATES SOCIAL
DIVISIVENESS BY REDUCING A WILLINGNESS TO SUPPORT
THE NEEDY THROUGH SOCIAL SECURITY.
IDEALLY, THE PROBLEM OF TAX AVOIDANCE
SHOULD BE OVERCOME DIRECTLY BY CLOSING THE
LOOPHOLES. BUT GIVEN THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL
PROBLEMS, NOTABLY THE ATTITUDE OF THE HIGH COURT
AND THE GOVERNMENT'S RELUCTANCE TO INTRODUCE A
RETROSPECTIVE BAN ON AVOIDANCE SCHEMES, THE
SCOPE FOR MAKING INCOME TAX MORE EQUITABLE IS
LIMITED, AND SOME OF ITS DISINCENTIVE EFFECTS
WOULD STILL REMAIN. THERE IS, THEREFORE, A STRONG
CASE FOR LESSENING THE RELIANCE ON INCOME TAX,
PROVIDED THE DISADVANTAGES OF INCREASED INDIRECT
TAX CAN BE OFFSET. THE REGRESSIVE NATURE OF A NEW
OR EXTENDED CONSUMPTION TAX WILL REQUIRE A
REVIEW OF SOCIAL SECURITY. ITS INFLATIONARY IMPACT
WILL REQUIRE OFFSETTING MONETARY MEASURES AND
AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE UNIONS FOR WAGE
RESTRAINT IN RETURN FOR INCOME TAX CUTS. AND
IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT AS PRICES OF
MANY MANUFACTURED GOODS ARE ALREADY BOOSTED
BY TARIFF AND IMPORT QUOTA PROTECTION, INCREASES
IN OVERT TAXATION ON GOODS MERIT A COMPENSATING
REDUCTION IN THE HIDDEN TAX OF PROTECTION.
BUT WHAT KIND OF CONSUMPTION TAX IS TO BE
PREFERRED? THIS RAISES FURTHER QUESTIONS. SHOULD
IT BE ONLY ON GOODS OR ALSO ON SERVICES? SHOULD
THERE BE EXEMPTIONS, SUCH AS ON FOOD AND OTHER
"NECESSITIES"? AT WHAT STAGE OF DISTRIBUTION
SHOULD IT BE LEVIED? SHOULD THERE A FLAT-RATE TAX
OR DIFFERENTIAL RATES? THE OPTIONS SUGGESTED BY
THE TREASURY INCLUDE A VALUE-ADDED TAX ON ALL OR
MOST GOODS AND SERVICES, LEVIED AT ALL STAGES OF
PRODUCTION. THIS, BECAUSE OF ITS COMPLEXITY, THE
PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER HAVE ALREADY RULED
OUT. THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE FOR A RETAIL TURNOVER
TAX ON GOODS, OR FOR A WHOLESALE TAX ON GOODS
PLUS A TAX ON SERVICES. THE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES
DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION HAS SUGGESTED A RETAIL
TAX ON GOODS PLUS A TAX ON SERVICES.
TO BE EQUITABLE AND ENSURE A BROAD REVENUE
BASE, A NEW CONSUMPTION TAX SHOULD COVER
SERVICES AS WELL AS GOODS. THE SIMPLEST AND LEAST
CONTROVERSIAL OPTION WOULD PROBABLY BE TO EXTEND
THE PRESENT SALES TAX SYSTEM, LEVIED AT THE
WHOLESALE STAGE, AND LINK IT WITH A TAX ON
SERVICES. FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY AND ECONOMY,
TO MINIMISE DISTORTIONS IN THE EFFICIENT ALLOCATION
OF RESOURCES AND TO AVOID ENDLESS ARGUMENTS
WITH PRESSURE GROUPS, A UNIFORM TAX WITH FEW
IF ANY EXEMPTIONS HAS ATTRACTIONS, PROVIDED A
RESTRUCTURED INCOME TAX AND SOCIAL SECURITY
SYSTEM COMPENSATES LOWER-INCOME EARNERS FOR
THE HIGHER COST OF LIVING. MR FRASER HAS HINTED
AT A CHANGE BEFORE JULY. BUT ALL THIS SHOULD BE
OPEN TO COMMUNITY DEBATE. THE GOVERNMENT
OUGHT TO SET OUT ALL THE OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
IN A GREEN PAPER BEFORE IT MAKES ITS DECISIONS.
THE REFORM OF THE TAX SYSTEM SURELY WARRANTS
THE WIDEST POSSIBLE EXPLANATION, CONSULTATION
AND DISCUSSION.
<F93>
FRIDAY 30 JANUARY 1981
"BATTLE WON, WAR GOES ON"
REDUCTION OF THE INFLATION RATE AS MEASURED
BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX TO LESS THAN
10 PER CENT IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT AND THE NATION. THE RISE OF 2.1 PER
CENT IN THE CPI FOR THE DECEMBER QUARTER BRINGS
THE RATE FOR 1980 DOWN TO 9.3 PER CENT, WHICH
IS BETTER THAN TREASURY FORECAST IN THE BUDGET.
THE MARCH QUARTER IS EXPECTED TO SHOW A
CONTINUATION OF THE DOWNWARD TREND. WHAT
MAKES THIS TREND ALL THE MORE SATISFYING FOR THE
GOVERNMENT IS THAT IS SUGGESTS THAT THE STRATEGY
OF FIGHTING INFLATION FIRST IS WORKING, AND THAT
AUSTRALIA'S INFLATION RATE IS RUNNING BELOW THAT
OF MOST OTHER ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL NATIONS. IT
MUST BE RECOGNISED, HOWEVER, THAT THIS IS PARTLY
A CONSEQUENCE OF GOOD FORTUNE, AUSTRALIA BEING
LESS DEPENDENT ON IMPORTED FUEL.
THERE ARE TWO SHADOWS LOOMING OVER THE
DOWNWARD TREND IN INFLATION. ONE HAS BEEN CAST
BY THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF. THE REDUCED INFLATION
RATE IN THE DECEMBER QUARTER WAS PARTLY DUE TO
INDIRECT TAXES BEING HELD STEADY AND TO MANY
PEOPLE OPTING OUT OF HEALTH INSURANCE. THE
GOVERNMENT SEEMS DETERMINED TO REVERSE BOTH
TRENDS. A SWITCH IN EMPHASIS FROM DIRECT TO
INDIRECT TAXATION HAS ATTRACTIONS, BUT IT WOULD
FEED INTO THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. THE
GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO WEIGHT VERY CAREFULLY
WHETHER THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING ABLE TO REDUCE
INCOME TAX WHILE INTRODUCING A TAX ON SPENDING
THAT CAN BE MORE EASILY ADJUSTED JUSTIFY AN
ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COST OF LIVING. THE
GOVERNMENT'S PREFERENCE FOR CHANGES IN THE
NATIONAL HEALTH SCHEME TO FORCE PEOPLE BACK
INTO PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD REDUCE
BUDGET OUTLAYS BUT ALSO BOOST THE CONSUMER
PRICE INDEX.
THE OTHER, MORE OMINOUS SHADOW IS THAT OF
A RENEWED INFLATIONARY WAGE PUSH. THE
ABANDONMENT OF WAGE INDEXATION WAS WELCOMED
BY SOME EMPLOYERS WHO FELT THAT REGULAR WAGE
RISES TIED TO CPI MOVEMENTS IMPOSED ON THEM
BURDENSOME COST INCREASES REGARDLESS OF THEIR
CAPACITY TO PAY. THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF ARGUED
THAT INDEXATION INSTITUTIONALISED INFLATION,
IMPEDED ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND INCREASED
UNEMPLOYMENT. IN THE ABSENCE OF INDEXATION,
UNIONS ARE LIKELY TO FELL EVEN LESS INHIBITED IN
PRESSING WAGE CLAIMS, AND MANY EMPLOYERS MAY
PREFER TO PAY UP RATHER THAN FACE PROLONGED
INDUSTRIAL DISTRUPTION. THE HOPE MUST THEREFORE
BE THAT THE ARBITRATION COMMISSION'S QUEST FOR
AGREEMENT ON A NEW WAGE-FIXING SYSTEM - ONE
THAT IS SOCIALLY EQUITABLE AS WELL AS ECONOMICALLY
RESPONSIBLE - WILL SUCCEED.
AN UNRESTRAINED WAGE PUSH WOULD NOT
ONLY REINFORCE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES BUT
REBOUND ON EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS. MUCH AS THE
GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE SATISFACTION IN ITS
SUCCESSFUL FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION AND IN SIGNS
OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY, THE UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES
ARE STILL GLOOMY. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY UNION
LEADERS REFUSE TO RECOGNISE THAT ONE MAN'S WAGE
RISE COULD COST ANOTHER MAN'S JOB. THE
GOVERNMENT SHOULD TRY TO PERSUADE THE TRADE
UNION MOVEMENT TO ACCEPT WAGE RESTRAINT AS A
TRADE-OFF FOR INCOME TAX CUTS MADE POSSIBLE BY
INCREASED INDIRECT TAX, BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF
SUCCESS IN THIS DIRECTION IS SLIGHT. AN INTRANSIGENT
UNION MOVEMENT AND INSENSITIVE GOVERNMENT
LEAVE LITTLE SCOPE FOR A COMMON APPROACH TO
ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.
"BACK TO WORK ON OMEGA"
AT LAST THE DEADLOCK ON THE OMEGA NAVIGATION
STATION IS TO BE BROKEN OPEN. FEDERAL
CABINET'S DECISION YESTERDAY TO ORDER AN
IMMEDIATE RESUMPTION OF WORK ON THE STATION
WAS OVERDUE. FOR 10 MONTHS ALL WORK AT THE
LONG-DISTANCE NAVIGATION STATION, NEAR YARRAM
IN SOUTH GIPPSLAND, HAS BEEN STOPPED BY A
CHILDISH DEMARCATION DISPUTE. MR NORM
GALLAGHER AND HIS BUILDERS LABORERS FEDERATION
DEMANDED THAT THE 16 JOBS ON THE STATION GO TO
MEMBERS OF HIS UNION RATHER THAN THE FEDERATED
IRONWORKERS ASSOCIATION. TO THIS END THE BLF
HAS MAINTAINED PICKETS ON THE SITE, LODGED THREE
COURT CHALLENGES, AND CREATED A FEAR OF
RETRIBUTION IF WORK CONTINUES.
THE FRASER GOVERNMENT HAS NOW DECIDED TO
DEFY THIS THREAT - AND RIGHTLY. AS LONG AS THE
16 WORKERS ARE PROPERLY REPRESENTED, IT DOES NOT
MATTER WHICH UNION THEY BELONG TO. THE HIGH
COURT APPEAL LODGED BY THE BLF CANNOT JUSTIFY
THE PROLONGED DELAY ON WORK AT THE STATION; ONLY
A PEDANTIC LEGALIST WOULD AGREE THAT WORK ON A
BUILDING SHOULD BE HALTED FOR A YEAR WHENEVER
ONE UNION CHOOSES TO TAKE ON ANOTHER IN THE
COURTS. NOR SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT BOW TO THE
BLF'S THREAT TO STOP WORK ON OTHER GOVERNMENT
PROJECTS. OTHER UNIONS CAN DO THE JOBS IF THE BLF
WON'T - AND MR GALLAGHER HAS CREATED A LARGE
COALITION OF ENEMIES AMONG THE OTHER BUILDING
TRADES UNIONS. BIG NORM MAY RUN HIS UNION BUT
HE DOES NOT RUN THE COUNTRY. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
TIMES WHEN HE NEEDS TO BE REMINDED OF THE
DIFFERENCE.
